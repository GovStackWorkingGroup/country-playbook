# Implementation framework

The GovStack implementation framework considers incorporating a BB approach at the level of institutional governance, ICT policy, and citizen-centric co-design and delivery of government digital services. The GovStack design principles guide this process, and the capacity to adopt the GovStack approach to service design and delivery is built every step of the way as part of the collaboration with the Country's digital team.&#x20;

To further facilitate the implementation process, the GovStack digital service co-design & delivery protocol presents a sequence of tools and methods to understand user needs, map user journeys & life events, as well as, to integrate prototypes in an agile way using reusable software components from GovStack sandbox. &#x20;

The aim of the **GovStack Digital Service co-Design & Delivery Protocol** is to facilitate digital teams around the world to build their own digital service design standard and government technology stack following the SDG digital investment framework. The starting point is the prioritization of one or two government services that use a small set of reusable software components (BBs) that will have high utilization by other services in the Country's service catalog.&#x20;
