# Reference Architecture

Reference architecture is the blueprint used to put the pieces of the organizational puzzle together. Digital teams use reference architecture to promote the reuse of common assets and identify capability gaps. It does this by:&#x20;

* Creating a common language for consistent communication within the organization&#x20;
* Outlining all capabilities needed to achieve the best outcome&#x20;
* Improving the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information &#x20;
* Establishing standard systems&#x20;
* Establishing a common way to exchange information

{% tab title="Activities" %}
* Review the GovStack Government Reference Architecture document
* Complement current GERA policy with the features that best fit your government's needs
* Identify learning modules within GovStack LMS to design a learning path for your digital team, as well as, digital teams in government entities &#x20;
* Alling ICT procurement guidelines to the GERA document
* Oficialized GERA Governance Committee as part of the CIO Council work plan, or the Inter-Ministerial Commission for the Development of Digital Government&#x20;
* Monitor and iterate the GERA Document as needed it to keep relevant for government service design and delivery at scale&#x20;

**Examples of Reference Architectures:**

* In Australia, their [reference architecture document](https://www.architecture.dta.gov.au/sp\_aga2?id=aga2\_how\_to\_use) provides digital teams the guidance they need to align current and emerging tech into a sound orchestration of solutions to enable digital government service design and delivery
