# Reference Architecture

Government Ecosystem Reference Architecture (GERA) provides a structured, model-driven methodology to support strategic changes in business operations and information systems. The drivers of an architecture project commonly include the need to address business-technology alignment and management of complexity. The architecture provides structure and rigor to documenting, analyzing and integrating the components of an enterprise, ranging from its business operating model to system design and physical technology infrastructure. The analysis considers both the present and future states of the business operating model and systems.

The main goal of the GERA is to provide an (approach to) open source reference architecture ecosystem supported by interoperable building blocks and digital service standards to leverage the efficiency and effectiveness of core government services through optimized digital infrastructure. The GERA encourages countries to adopt its framework to develop the Minimum Viable Products (in the short run) so as to move towards the giant leap of digital transformation (in the long run); both may be useful to be referred by the decision makers.

Reference architecture is the blueprint used to put the pieces of the organizational puzzle together. Digital teams use reference architecture to promote the reuse of common assets and identify capability gaps ([NSW Government n.d.](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit/resources/technology-and-tools/reference-architecture))&#x20;

It does this by:&#x20;

* Creating a common language for consistent communication within the organization&#x20;
* Outlining all capabilities needed to achieve the best outcome&#x20;
* Improving the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information &#x20;
* Establishing standard systems&#x20;
* Establishing a common way to exchange information

* In New South Wales Australia, their [reference architecture document](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit/resources/technology-and-tools/reference-architecture) provides digital teams the guidance they need to align current and emerging tech into a sound orchestration of solutions to enable digital government service design and delivery
* [Architecture and non-functional requirements](http://localhost:5000/s/Mv07ks4AhtBDCIkO2zgW/building-blocks/architecture-and-nonfunctional-requirements)
* [GovStack Ecosystem Reference Architecture and Business Guide for Public Digital Platforms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qa31kAy\_Kz9MsphXunS0UqRJpoQ2i8HV/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=107531587157017296326\&rtpof=true\&sd=true),  [The Open Group Standard](https://www.opengroup.org/)

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
The blend of GEA with GovStack's building blocks approach simply offers multiple advantages such as cost-saving, speed, real economic return, agility combined with responsiveness, integration and exchange of information to achieve interoperability, adherence to common standards, minimized vendor lock-in.

This guide primarily focusses on the following:

1\.      Understanding the GovStackâ€™s structure and its value proposition

2\.      Integration of GovStack with Digital Government Enterprise Architecture

_3._      Reference Case studies
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
* Review the GovStack Government Reference Architecture document
* Complement current GERA policy with the features that best fit your government's needs
* Identify learning modules within GovStack LMS to design a learning path for your digital team, as well as, digital teams in government entities &#x20;
* Alling ICT procurement guidelines to the GERA document
* Oficialized GERA Governance Committee as part of the CIO Council work plan, or the Inter-Ministerial Commission for the Development of Digital Government&#x20;
* Monitor and iterate the GERA Document as needed it to keep relevant for government service design and delivery at scale&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital Team" %}
Who does what:

* Chief government architects - Coordinate the work around the GERA document&#x20;
* [Solutions architects](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/\~/changes/389/govstack-implementation-playbook/sample-digital-team-composition/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#solution-architect) from government entities - Actively participate in the co-design of the document, the GERA working group, and the training program&#x20;
* [Service designers](http://localhost:5000/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zdXe8NbIMZIv5sydPBf6/) - Actively participate in co-design sessions, the GERA working groups and the training program&#x20;
