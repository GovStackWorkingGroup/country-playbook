# Scaling strategy

## &#x20;Co-design the scaling strategy

The scaling strategy refers to a plan or approach (digitization roadmap) to grow the national tech-stack, infrastructure, capacity building, and the number of citizen-centric digital government services according to the [prioritization strategy](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/\~/changes/501/govstack-implementation-playbook/adopt-govstack/copy-of-service-prioritization) and simultaneously update legal frameworks.

Countries can catalog services and identify existing software components, choose an initial prioritized service, and procure/develop/adopt additional building blocks to digitize the service.&#x20;

As depicted in the image above, experience from the initial prioritized services digital teams can iterate, streamline, and further customize the GovStack service design and delivery approach to scale it for the remaining services on their [service catalog](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/\~/changes/501/govstack-implementation-playbook/adopt-govstack/service-catalog).

The specific strategy for scaling can vary depending on the country's financial resources, digital talent availability, GovTech ecosystem maturity among other factors that guide the scope of the activities within a timeframe captured in a digitization roadmap.&#x20;

The image below is an example of a digitization roadmap template that will be developed as part of the Horn of Africa GovStack collaboration. &#x20;

{% tab title="Activities /resources" %}
* Establish digital service teams within each government entity to:
  * Participate in the co-design sessions of the scaling strategy/digital roadmap
  * Agree on a follow-up mechanism and KPIs for the implementation of the roadmap
  * Lead the implementation of the scaling strategy/digitization roadmap within each entity
  * Align ICT investment/procurement to scaling strategy
* Publish the digitization roadmap as a legally binding digital norm for all government entities to follow and implement. An example of a digital roadmap is [Australia](https://www.dta.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-12/Digital%20Government%20Strategy\_web-ready\_FA.pdf).
* Introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework/ set of bylaws to make the roadmap of digitizing services actionable. This will include:
  * Digital Service Standard and Delivery Protocol, following are a few examples: [Mexico](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zdXe8NbIMZIv5sydPBf6/); [UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), [France](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/)
  * Enterprise architecture,&#x20;
  * Shared service policy with a cross-cutting mandate, and
  * ICT procurement policy
* Develop a [capacity-building strategy](learning-and-exchange/capacity-building/framework.md) for all public servants involved in the digitization of services and a digital inclusion strategy for the users of the digital services. [Use of Current digital capability in the country (Request for Information, RFI-4)](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/guide-de-mise-en-oeuvre-de-govstack/apprentissage-et-echange/artefacts#current-digital-capability-in-country-request-for-information-rfi-4) provides an understanding of the current status quo regarding digital capability in the country.
* Procure/set-up Building Blocks
* Maintain, update, publish, and ensure digital teams across departments use only the latest versions of the:
  * Reference architecture
  * Systems catalog
  * [Service catalog](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/\~/changes/501/govstack-implementation-playbook/adopt-govstack/service-catalog)
  * [Capacity building strategy](learning-and-exchange/capacity-building/framework.md)
  * Digital inclusion strategy
* Implement a publicly accessible dashboard that showcases the strategy, progress made on the roadmap, and performance indicators. Examples of dashboards are:
  * [Peru digital government dashboard](https://indicadores.digital.gob.pe/)
  * [UK governemnt performance dashboard](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20210315084926/https://www.gov.uk/performance)
