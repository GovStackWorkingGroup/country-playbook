# Govstack design principles

GovStack design principles guide our design and delivery work. They are based on the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/) and offer specific best practices to make our digital work better. As you engage in implementing a GovStack approach to citizen-centric digitization of government services you will see these principles embedded in our iteration processes, tools and methods. We invite you to embrace them and make this your way of work at your organization and digital team.  &#x20;

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-01.png>) | **Design with the user**: User-centered design starts with getting to know the people you are designing for through conversation, observation, and co-creation.                                                                                                                           |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-02.png>) | **Understand the existing ecosystem**: Well-designed initiatives and digital tools consider the particular structures and needs that exist in each country, region, and community.                                                                                                        |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-03.png>) | **Design for scale**: Achieving scale requires adoption beyond an initiative's pilot population and often necessitates securing funding or partners that take the initiative to new communities or regions.                                                                               |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-04.png>) | **Build for Sustainability**: Building sustainable programs, platforms and digital tools is essential to maintain user and stakeholder support, as well as to maximize long-term impact.                                                                                                  |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-05.png>) | **Be Data Driven**: When an initiative is data-driven, quality information is available to the right people when they need it, and they are using it to take action.                                                                                                                      |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-10.png>) | **Use Open Standards**, open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation: An open approach to digital development can help to increase collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplicating work that has already been done.                                               |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-09.png>) | **Reuse and Improve**: Reusing and improving is about taking the work of the global development community further than any organization or program can do alone                                                                                                                           |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-08.png>) | **Address Privacy and Security**: Addressing privacy and security in digital development involves careful consideration of which data are collected and how data are acquired, used, stored and shared.                                                                                   |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-07.png>) | **Be collaborative**: Being collaborative means sharing information, insights, strategies and resources across projects, organizations and sectors, leading to increased efficiency and impact.                                                                                           |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-06.png>) | **Iterate then Iterate again**: The best way to build good digital government services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release minimum viable products early, test them with actual users, move from version to version adding features based on feedback. Iteration reduces risk.  |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-11.png>) | **Maintain trace**: We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, and with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service, the better it gets, and the bar is raised.         |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-12.png>) | **Build Digital Services, not websites**: A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs and build the service that meets those needs. Of course, much of that will be pages on the web, but we’re not here to build websites.                |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-13.png>) | **Design for everyone**: Accessible design is good design. Services should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. Services should be built for needs and designed for the whole country, not just the ones who are used to using the web.                                     |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Design principles\_-14.png>) | **Do the hard work to make it simple**: Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder. Don’t take “It’s always been that way” for an answer. It’s usually more and harder work to make things simple, but it’s the right thing to do.               |
