# E-participation

## E-participation, e-democracy

Both e-participation and e-democracy are important factors in creating citizens-centric digital government services. &#x20;

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs "E-Participation is about fostering civic engagement and open, participatory governance through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs). Growing evidence points to the rapid expansion of e-Participation as a tool for engagement and strengthened collaboration between governments and citizens. Its objective is to improve access to information and public services as well as to promote participation in policy-making, both for the empowerment of individual citizens and the benefit of society as a whole." ([United Nations n.d.](https://publicadministration.un.org/en/eparticipation))&#x20;

e-Democracy is considered to be an integral part of e-governance development as it has the power to enrich and transform the existing channels for state-society relations and governance regimes through digital tools ([e-Governance Academy n.d.](https://ega.ee/e-democracy/)) However, online citizen engagement can be affected by a large number of technological, political, legal, and social barriers that need to be explored in detail and reflected in the country's digital strategies.

Challenges to e-participation include:&#x20;

* Scale (how to design a technology to support an individual to actively participate)&#x20;
* Building capacity and active citizenship (how to design e-engagement tools that will provide citizens not only to participate in, but also to understand decision-making processes).&#x20;
* Ensuring coherence (Informing, consulting, participating, analyzing, providing feedback, evaluating).&#x20;
* Evaluating e-engagement (do e-engagement tools help to achieve citizens’ and governments’ objectives).&#x20;
* Ensuring commitment&#x20;
