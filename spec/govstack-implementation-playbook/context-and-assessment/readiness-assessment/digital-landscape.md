# Digital landscape

## Country digital landscape and maturity

Wide ICT usage, coverage, and accessibility are key enablers of innovative services development and citizen uptake. Given its importance, ICT usage is a crucial factor in the assessment of any country’s digital landscape and maturity. Meaningful connectivity can be unpacked into a few indicators, including:

* Percentage of the population covered by at least a 3G mobile network
* Percentage of the population covered by at least an LTE/WIMAX mobile network&#x20;
* Number of fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants
* Number of active mobile broadband subs per 100 inhabitants&#x20;
* Percentage of individuals using the Internet&#x20;

While availability is a major issue, uptake is strongly determined by the affordability of ICT. ITU provides a [unique data set about the affordability of ICT services around the world](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Dashboards/Pages/IPB.aspx) (ICT Price Baskets n.d) which includes two crucial indicators to be taken into consideration when analyzing the country’s digital market: &#x20;

* Data-only mobile broadband basket cost for a minimum monthly allowance of 2GB as a percentage of monthly GNI per capita (% GNI p.c.)&#x20;
* &#x20;Fixed-broadband basket cost for a minimum monthly allowance of 5GB as a percentage of monthly GNI per capita (% GNI p.c.)&#x20;

In this sense, the country’s digital landscape and maturity should be analyzed from two dimensions: dynamics and the affordability target set by the United Nations Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development. The latest one sets the affordability target at 2% monthly GNI per capita, which shall be reached by all the countries by 2025. &#x20;

The [e-Government Development Index (EGDI)](https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/About/Overview/-E-Government-Development-Index) and [e-Participation Index (EPART)](https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/About/Overview/E-Participation-Index) value and ranking are relevant instruments that can help governments gain a better understanding of their country’s e-governance development and positioning in the regional context. These indices cover e-government trends over an extended period of time-based on a consistent methodology that has kept up to date with new e-government developments.

Moreover, the [GovTech Maturity Index (Dener et al. 2021)](http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36233) provides a snapshot of the country’s maturity by measuring its stand on core government systems (COSI), public service delivery (PSDI), citizen engagement (CEI), and GovTech Enablers (GTEI). This index can also help identify factors that diminish the country’s overall progress
