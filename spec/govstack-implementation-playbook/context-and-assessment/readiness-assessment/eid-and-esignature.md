# eID & eSignature

Digital identity and digital signatures are the core components of public service development. Government services heavily depend on the users’ ability to identify themselves simply and securely. Therefore, governments aiming to be digital and user-centric provide citizens with one or multiple ways to authenticate themselves while accessing government services. These authentication methods can include digital ID, mobile ID, and digital signature, for example.

Most of these tools draw on a Public Key Infrastructure that consists of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption ([Governance Academy 2022](https://ega.ee/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kenya-Digital-Readiness-Study.pdf))&#x20;

To assess the country’s level of digital identity and digital signature development, the following questions shall be addressed:&#x20;

* Does the country have a digital identity and digital signature legal framework in place?&#x20;
* What are the entities responsible for the development and regulation of such tools?&#x20;
* What is the number of citizens using the tools?&#x20;
* How affordable for the citizen is the digital identity and/or digital signature?&#x20;
* Are the digital identity and/or digital signature accessible/easy to get for citizens?&#x20;
* What types of signatures and standards are used in the country?&#x20;
