# Digital skills

Digital skills are a key enabler of the digital transformation journey. Identifying existing digital talent and talent gaps is an important preliminary step as the entire digitalization process largely depends on such skills.

It is crucial and highly recommendable to lay a common digital mindset among the country's population. This could be achieved, for example, through the inclusion of digital skills in education pathways for civil society.

In addition to equipping all citizens and public officials with basic skills, government entities need [ICT experts](../../sample-digital-team-composition/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy.md) with advanced IT and project management skills to maintain the ICT architecture, provide user support, manage ICT procurements, and implement the governmentâ€™s digital strategy.

Such public officials/civil servants, Digital Transformation Project Managers, and ICT specialists, among other professionals, should be involved in regular internal [capacity strengthening measures](../../learning-and-exchange/govlearn.md) to keep pace with new technologies and to be able to continuously foster a digital society.

As an organization progresses through each implementation stage, it is advisable to establish [a digital talent archive](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/capacity-development/digital-skills-in-relation-to-capacity-building) that supports the workforce in the long run ([e-Governance Academy 2022](https://ega.ee/publication/study-kenya-digital-readiness/)).

The following questions can support the analysis of the country's current state of digital skills:

*   Education sector&#x20;

    * Are digital skills and ICT in education clearly defined priorities in different strategic policy papers? If so, is this approach to digital skills development integrated and effective implementation being ensured?&#x20;
    * Is internet connectivity, electricity, teacher training and information security ensured to set the base for comprehensive ICT literacy within the education system?&#x20;
    * Is there a clear alignment and cooperation between what is offered at universities and what is demanded by the market (such as cooperation with ICT sector representatives to update the curricula with modern skills needed in the market; flexibility to change curricula according to market needs, incentives for internships)?&#x20;
    * Are science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs in place, and the attraction of such for the civil society a priority of the government? &#x20;

    &#x20;
* General public&#x20;
  * Are Digital Skills Programmes launched to provide digital literacy? If so, does this include computer and internet training, awareness-raising of information literacy and tips for better protection of personal data (cyber hygiene)?&#x20;
  * Do (good) examples of public-private partnerships exist to increase the number of skilled ICT-experts?&#x20;
  * Are ICT skills audit being conducted to identify gaps in public sector digital skills and mindset?&#x20;
