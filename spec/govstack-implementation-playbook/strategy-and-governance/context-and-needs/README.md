## Readiness assessment

To advance the GovStack implementation in the country, there is a need to draw a simple overview with clear narratives about the country’s capacity to digitally transform and the various components contributing to this process.

All stakeholders must be involved in the process of readiness assessment. They should go through all chapters the assessment will cover, the expectations the implementing government (national, regional, municipal) has on the content, and what documents done by the country should be consulted. It should also be agreed upon whether the paper will be public or not.

The readiness assessment responds to this need by analyzing the current digital readiness of the public sector, thus providing stakeholders with a good understanding of the current digitalization landscape in the country. It draws general findings in key areas and guides further activities for the development and implementation of strategic national documents and projects on digital transformation.

The assessment may benefit from secondary research, including various publications of the GovStack founding partners, multiple resources provided by the development partners of the implementing country, as well as additional research in the form of questionnaires, meetings, and interviews.

When following the GovStack country engagement journey, a minimum level of data needs to be gathered across all countries GovStack is collaborating with. While having an opportunity to collaborate with numerous partners who use different approaches in performing the readiness assessment, having the minimum required set of data will ensure proper monitoring and allow measuring the impact over time in the reference implementation countries.

The assessment should also offer a solid base for advancing on the necessary steps in the process of digital service implementation. A good example of the usefulness of this kind of assessment can be found in the framework put in place by the Government of Ukraine and presented below. This Ukrainian framework demonstrates the importance of carrying out a comprehensive analysis at the beginning of the journey, whose outcomes shape subsequent steps along the digitisation workflow

The e-Governance Academy Digital Readiness Study provides an overview of digitisation in the country and advances recommendations that can inform the development and implementation of strategic national documents and projects in the field of digital government. The study’s assessment methodology is follows five steps: 1) Preliminary research; 2) Digital Readiness Study questionnaire; 3) Preparations for online data collection interviews; 4) Conducting interviews with key stakeholders; and 5) Development of the Digital Readiness Study report.

The report reviews the country’s current state of digital readiness in specific focus areas and provides suggestions for the next steps. It also covers the minimum level of data required for embarking the country on the GovStack engagement journey ([e-Governance Digital Readiness Study 2022](https://ega.ee/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kenya-Digital-Readiness-Study.pdf))&#x20;

The [Kenyan e-Governance Academy Digital Readiness Study](https://ega.ee/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kenya-Digital-Readiness-Study.pdf) is just one example of the approaches that partner organizations use to assess the country’s readiness. Other methodologies and frameworks include:
