# Access

## Access and awareness raising

To harness the advantages a digital society brings, citizens and businesses should be able to access public services online. These should not simply be available, but also inclusive, user-friendly, and easy to access on different devices and platforms.

To communicate with the public, any administration should establish a device and technology-agnostic channel, such as a government portal, operating on different devices. Such a platform should be used to provide both information services and procedural services. A well-functioning digital information channel will transform government services into a single whole (one-stop-shop) and improve the availability of public services.

A basic framework to assess the maturity of access to e-services can be divided into five levels:

Level 1: Information exists electronically about the service.&#x20;

Level 2: One-way communication: Forms can be downloaded from the internet, to be filled in, and submitted manually.&#x20;

Level 3: Two-way communication: Forms can be filled in and submitted online and the public service will be triggered for the authorized user.&#x20;

Level 4: Transaction: Services can be provided fully online by electronically submitting filled-in forms or data for processing. The output is also delivered electronically.&#x20;

Level 5: Personalized service: The entire service can be performed online, automatically, and proactively &#x20;
