# Interoperability

In the context of digital government, interoperability is the ability of ICT systems and business processes in government agencies to share information and knowledge within and across organizational boundaries, in order to better support the provision of public services as well as strengthen support for the implementation of public policies and processes.&#x20;

For this section we adopt the Interoperability Maturity Assessment of a Public Service (IMAPS)  tool in order to assess and improve the behavioral interoperability maturity of a digital public service.  The IMPAS provides public administrations insight into two key aspects of their interoperability performance:&#x20;

• The current interoperability maturity level of a Public Service&#x20;

• Improvement priorities to reach the next level of interoperability maturity&#x20;

&#x20;

IMAPS uses a five-stage model to indicate the interoperability maturity of the digital public service. Using maturity levels allows to:&#x20;

• Measure the interoperability maturity of the digital public service as a whole as well as underlying aspects;&#x20;

• Indicate which capabilities and next steps are required to reach higher levels, and thus improve interoperability maturity.&#x20;

&#x20;&#x20;

A five-stage approach is often seen in proven maturity models and is considered as best practice for assessing and improving maturity. The five maturity levels for IMAPS are summarised in the table below.&#x20;

The desired interoperability level for a digital public service is at least level 4: “Sustainable”. At this level, the digital public service is considered to have implemented all relevant best practices.
