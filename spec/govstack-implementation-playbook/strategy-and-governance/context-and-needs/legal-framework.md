# Legal framework

Digital transformation requires strategic and legal frameworks that keep pace with the evolving nature of digitisation. These frameworks define the current and future priorities and help stakeholders follow the joint vision and align their efforts towards common goals.

A national digital strategy, together with a digital service roadmap, 5G Strategy, AI strategy, or other strategic frameworks governing the latest technology trends are important prerequisites for triggering a fundamental shift.

The analysis of the strategic framework is a fundamental stage that shall be coupled with the analysis of the legal framework. This legal scan should include specialized legislation on e-governance, open-data, public-private partnership, among other relevant sectors and activities.

The importance of this analysis can’t be stressed enough, as major changes in public service architecture and workflows may require new or amended legislation.

The [ITU Regulatory Tracker](https://app.gen5.digital/tracker/metrics?\_gl=1\*7u4bar\*\_ga\*Nzc3MjQyMjY0LjE2NjExNTg4NTc.\*\_ga\_27GW57NRWK\*MTY2MTE5NzYxNy4xLjEuMTY2MTE5ODMyNi4wLjAuMA..&\_ga=2.43585701.1217164096.1661158857-777242264.1661158857) can be used to assess the country’s regulatory landscape. It facilitates benchmarking and the identification of trends and gaps in ICT legal and regulatory frameworks and allows decision-makers to make the case for further regulatory reform toward achieving a vibrant and inclusive ICT sector.

It is composed of 50 indicators grouped into four clusters: regulatory authority, regulatory mandates, regulatory regime, and competition framework for the ICT sector. The generation of ITU framework regulation reflects this evolution holistically, looking at how governments have configured their legal and institutional frameworks for digital transformation. The fifth generation of collaborative regulation is the next frontier in terms of holistic digital regulation.

The latest version of [the G5 Benchmark](https://app.gen5.digital/benchmark/about) takes data from 193 countries and expands to cover four pillars, with 70 indicators taken into account. The pillars are: &#x20;

* National Collaborative Governance&#x20;
* Policy Design Principles&#x20;
* Digital Development and&#x20;
* Digital Economic Policy Agenda.&#x20;
