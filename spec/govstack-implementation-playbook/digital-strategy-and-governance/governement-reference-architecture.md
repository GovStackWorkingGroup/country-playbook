# Governement Ecosystem Reference Architecture (GERA)

## Overview of GERA

Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA) provides a structured, model-driven methodology to approach strategic transformations, in both business operations as well as for supporting information systems. The drivers for an architecture project commonly include the need to address business-technology alignment and management of complexity. The architecture provides structure and rigor to documenting, analyzing and integrating the components of an enterprise, ranging from its business operating model to system design, to physical technology infrastructure. Analysis is performed between the current state business and the current state systems, as well as between the current and future state of the business operating model.

The chief objective of the GERA is to provide an (approach to) open source reference architecture ecosystem supported by interoperable building blocks, digital service standards so as to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of core government services through optimized digital infrastructure. The GERA encourages the nations to adopt the framework to develop the Minimum Viable Products (in the short run) so as to move towards the giant leap of digital transformation (in the long run); both may be useful to be referred by the decision makers.

Reference architecture is the blueprint you use to put the pieces of a puzzle together. Digital teams use reference architecture to promote the reuse of common assets, and identify gaps in capability.

It does this by:&#x20;

* Creating common language for consistent communication within the organisation&#x20;
* Cutlining all capabilities needed to achieve the best outcome&#x20;
* Improving the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information &#x20;
* Establishing standard systems&#x20;
* Establishing a common way to exchange information

The blend of GEA with GovStack's building blocks approach simply offers multiple advantages such as cost-saving, speed, real economic return, agility combined with responsiveness, integration and exchange of information to achieve interoperability, adherence to common standards, minimized vendor lock-in.

This guide primarily focusses on the following:

1\.      Understanding the GovStackâ€™s structure and its value proposition

2\.      Integration of GovStack with Digital Government Enterprise Architecture

_3._      Reference Case studies
