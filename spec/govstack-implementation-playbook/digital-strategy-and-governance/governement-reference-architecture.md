# Governement Reference Architecture

Reference architecture is the blueprint you use to put the pieces of a puzzle together. Digital teams use reference architecture to promote the reuse of common assets, and identify gaps in capability. ([Cite](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit/resources/technology-and-tools/reference-architecture))&#x20;

It does this by:&#x20;

* Creating common language for consistent communication within the organisation&#x20;
* Cutlining all capabilities needed to achieve the best outcome&#x20;
* Improving the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information &#x20;
* Establishing standard systems&#x20;
* Establishing a common way to exchange information

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
GovStack architecture document outline requirements that apply to all building blocks, including:

* Guidelines&#x20;
* Principles&#x20;
* Cross-cutting requirements&#x20;
* Standards, and
* Shared terminology
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
To create a Government Enterprise Architecture digital teams:

* Review of existing national e-government standards and recommend improvements;
* Propose the legal and regulatory basis for the Government Enterprise Architecture and the E-Government Interoperability Framework;
* Develop the systems integration security strategy;
* Propose supporting standards for the interoperability framework;
* Adopt and implement a government enterprise architecture;
* Carry out change management and raise awareness of government officials;

{% tab title="Digital team" %}
Enterprise architecture documents follow an interactive co-design process where all members of a digital should participate. The most common roles leading the co-design process of a GERA document are:

* Service designers
* Solution architect&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Next steps" %}
Once a GERA document has been release digital teams:&#x20;

* Recognize contributors&#x20;
* Incorpore GERA training and learning materials in Country Public Sector Digital Skills Program and IT suppliers training program
* Use the document as guideline for scaling digitalization of 100% of government services&#x20;
