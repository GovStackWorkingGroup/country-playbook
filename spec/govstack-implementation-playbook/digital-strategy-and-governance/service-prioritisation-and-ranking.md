# Service prioritisation and ranking

Definition of which services digitize first varies country from country. Prioritization criteria shall be based on data gathered through RFI, II, III, & IV in order to rank services to work with according to impact & feasibility criteria. &#x20;

&#x20;

The criteria presented in this playbook is a reference criteria. Each country can calibrate current criteria according to information availability, context & needs. &#x20;

&#x20;

Table X Impact & feasibility criteria &#x20;

&#x20;

Prior to prioritization and ranking stage, a country must identify a set of services that are part of their digital agenda. These may be outline in policy documents such as a country's Digital strategy, Digital Roadmap, etc.; or a result of stakeholder consultation lead by the country Digital Team.&#x20;

&#x20;

The prioritization and ranking exercise will be based on a multiple criteria analysis: "importance" & "feasibility". For each criteria, a set of indicators are defined and aligned with the data gathered through the Request for Information Forms (RFI) I, II, III & IV. (Table X Impact & feasibility criteria)&#x20;

&#x20;

Implementation will therefore be guided by the previous analysis, starting with services that are of the highest importance and highest feasibility, followed by those with high importance but low feasibility, those with low importance but with high feasibility and lastly services with low importance and low feasibility. &#x20;

&#x20;

The criteria presented in this playbook is a reference criteria. Each country can calibrate current criteria according to information availability, context & needs. &#x20;

Once information has been gathered and validated with different service owners strategic services will be accommodated in a matrix (see figure XX) format to facilitate clustering and ranking (figure XX).
