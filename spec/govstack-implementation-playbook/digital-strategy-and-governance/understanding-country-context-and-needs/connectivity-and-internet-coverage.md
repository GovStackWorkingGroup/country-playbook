# Connectivity and internet coverage

<details>

<summary>Wide ICT usage, coverage, and accessibility</summary>

Wide ICT usage, coverage, and accessibility represent a critical precondition and the foundation for innovative services development and their further use by the citizens. These need to be evaluated based on several aspects critical to meaningful connectivity:&#x20;

* &#x20;Percentage of population covered by at least a 3G mobile network&#x20;
* &#x20;Percentage of population covered by at least an LTE/WIMAX mobile network&#x20;
* &#x20;Number of fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants&#x20;
* &#x20;Number of active mobile broadband subs per 100 inhabitants&#x20;
* &#x20;Percentage of individuals using the Internet&#x20;

<summary>Affordability of ICT</summary>

In addition to the availability, uptake is strongly determined by the affordability of ICT. ITU provides a [unique data set about the affordability of ICT services around the world](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Dashboards/Pages/IPB.aspx) (ICT Price Baskets) which includes two crucial indicators to be taken into consideration when analyzing the countryâ€™s digital market: &#x20;

* Data-only mobile broadband basket cost for a minimum monthly allowance of 2GB as a percentage of monthly GNI per capita (% GNI p.c.)&#x20;
* &#x20;Fixed-broadband basket cost for a minimum monthly allowance of 5GB as a percentage of monthly GNI per capita (% GNI p.c.)&#x20;
