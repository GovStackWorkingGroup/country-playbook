# Leadership and Governance

The trend towards a digital society has caused many governments to adapt their position and their role in order to be able to provide adequate digital government services.&#x20;

Digital government transformation therefore often comes with the need for changes especially in  legal, institutional, technological, and cultural matters. High-level political commitment is critical to helping the government make necessary reforms in a timely and effective manner. &#x20;

Leading countries in digital government have shown to have strong political leadership, clear vision and strategy, effective governance and organizational structure, and secured funding resources.  \
In the following, we would like to present guiding questions that can be assessed and answered by the government with regards to its leadership and governance readiness. An internal self-assessment of such will help to focus on potential gaps that could be addressed as a priority: &#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Vission" %}


* Does the Government have a shared vision for digital transformation? A digital strategy linked to the national development agenda?&#x20;
* Do top Government leaders (e.g., Ministers, Under-Secretaries, Departments Heads, etc.) understand, own and support the digital government vision? Are non-Government stakeholders included and consulted in the digital government strategy and implementation?&#x20;
* Is the government's vision/digital strategy communicated internally? And externally?&#x20;
* Does the vision set specific goals for citizens, businesses, employees and other stakeholders?&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Strategy" %}
* Are there key performance indicators for measuring the implementation of strategy?&#x20;
* Does the government run digital government innovation competitions? &#x20;
* Is there a clear implementation road map? If so, is there a clear responsibility distribution in place?&#x20;
* Does the digital strategy have clear and quantifiable goals aligned with national priorities? Are these aligned with SDGs?&#x20;
* Is the digital strategy integrated into other national policies and plans as well as sector strategies? &#x20;
* Does the organizational and governance structure enable the coordination of design and delivery of people-centred services across government?&#x20;
* Are there dedicated professional cadres and Technical leaders (CIO/CDO or alike) who oversee digital strategies and drive change across government?&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Citizen-Centredness" %}
* Is the digital strategy designed around the most pressing needs of people? Was it a co-design process involving the citizens in its development? Is a feedback mechanism in place through which citizens can constantly provide their opinion regarding improvements?&#x20;
* Is there a cross-government platform to ensure citizen-centric design and use of common data and services?&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Funding " %}
* Does the government have the sustained funding to implement its digital strategy? Is there a dedicated budget line for digital government?&#x20;
* Is there a system and processes to monitor government's financial expenditures on digitization based on clear government-wide digital procurement policy?&#x20;
* Is budget allocation to the digital government strategy tied to KPI and results, cross-agency collaboration, and maintenance and operations?&#x20;
