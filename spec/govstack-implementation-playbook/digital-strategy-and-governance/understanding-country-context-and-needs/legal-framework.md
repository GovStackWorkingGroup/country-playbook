# Legal framework

Digital transformation requires an up-to-date and dynamic strategic and legal framework. It defines the current and future states as well as helps stakeholders follow the joint vision and align their efforts to support the common goal.&#x20;

The national digital strategy, together with the digital service roadmap, 5G Strategy, AI strategy, or other strategies featuring the latest technology trends are important prerequisites for triggering a fundamental shift.&#x20;

The analysis of the strategic framework is a fundamental stage that shall be followed by the one covering the legal framework. This legal overview should include specialized legislation on e-governance, open-data, public-private-partnership, etc.&#x20;

The importance of this analysis can’t be undermined, as major changes in public service architecture and workflows may require new or amended legislation.&#x20;

In case of a need to assess the country’s stand from a wider regulatory standpoint, the [ITU Regulatory Tracker](https://app.gen5.digital/tracker/metrics?\_gl=1\*7u4bar\*\_ga\*Nzc3MjQyMjY0LjE2NjExNTg4NTc.\*\_ga\_27GW57NRWK\*MTY2MTE5NzYxNy4xLjEuMTY2MTE5ODMyNi4wLjAuMA..&\_ga=2.43585701.1217164096.1661158857-777242264.1661158857) can be used. It facilitates benchmarking and the identification of trends and gaps in ICT legal and regulatory frameworks and allows decision-makers to make the case for further regulatory reform toward achieving a vibrant and inclusive ICT sector. &#x20;

It is composed of 50 indicators grouped into four clusters: regulatory authority, regulatory mandates, regulatory regime, and competition framework for the ICT sector.&#x20;

The ITU framework of generations of regulation reflects this evolution holistically, looking at how governments have configured their legal and institutional frameworks for the digital transformation. The fifth generation of collaborative regulation is the next frontier in terms of holistic digital regulation.&#x20;

The latest version of [the G5 Benchmark](https://app.gen5.digital/benchmark/about) takes data from 193 countries and expands to cover four pillars, with 70 indicators taken into account. The pillars are: &#x20;

* National Collaborative Governance&#x20;
* Policy Design Principles&#x20;
* Digital Development and&#x20;
* Digital Economic Policy Agenda.&#x20;
