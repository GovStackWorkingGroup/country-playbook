# Country digital landscape & maturity

Wide ICT usage, coverage, and accessibility represent a critical precondition and the foundation for innovative services development and their further use by the citizens. These need to be evaluated based on several aspects critical to meaningful connectivity:&#x20;

* &#x20;Percentage of population covered by at least a 3G mobile network&#x20;
* &#x20;Percentage of population covered by at least an LTE/WIMAX mobile network&#x20;
* &#x20;Number of fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants&#x20;
* &#x20;Number of active mobile broadband subs per 100 inhabitants&#x20;
* &#x20;Percentage of individuals using the Internet&#x20;

In addition to the availability, uptake is strongly determined by the affordability of ICT. ITU provides a [unique data set about the affordability of ICT services around the world](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Dashboards/Pages/IPB.aspx) (ICT Price Baskets) which includes two crucial indicators to be taken into consideration when analyzing the country’s digital market: &#x20;

* Data-only mobile broadband basket cost for a minimum monthly allowance of 2GB as a percentage of monthly GNI per capita (% GNI p.c.)&#x20;
* &#x20;Fixed-broadband basket cost for a minimum monthly allowance of 5GB as a percentage of monthly GNI per capita (% GNI p.c.)&#x20;

The country’s results in this sense should be analyzed from two dimensions, in dynamics and in relation to the affordability target set by the United Nations Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development. The latest one sets the affordability target at 2% monthly GNI per capita, which shall be reached by all the countries by 2025. &#x20;

For getting a clear understanding of the country’s e-governance development and positioning in the regional context, it is equally important to assess the evolution based on [e-Government Development Index (EGDI)](https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/About/Overview/-E-Government-Development-Index) and [e-Participation Index (EPART)](https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/About/Overview/E-Participation-Index) value and ranking. &#x20;

Still, while examining the EGDI and EPART trends over an extended period of time, it should be noted that the methodological framework has remained consistent across Survey periods, but its components have been updated to reflect new trends in e-government.&#x20;

In its turn, the [GovTech Maturity Index](http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36233) will provide a snapshot of the country’s maturity by measuring its stand on core government systems (COSI), public service delivery (PSDI), citizen engagement (CEI), and GovTech Enablers (GTEI). This index can also help identify factors that diminish the country’s overall progress.&#x20;
