# Access to e-services, awareness raising

To be able to benefit from the advantages a digital society brings, citizens and businesses should be able to access public services online. These should not simply be available, but also easy to access on different devices and platforms, inclusive and user-friendly. &#x20;

To communicate with the public, any administration should establish a device and technology agnostic digital information channel, such as a government portal, operating on different devices. This information channel is used to provide both information services and procedural services. A well-functioning digital information channel will transform government services into a single whole (one-stop-shop) and improve the availability of public services. &#x20;

&#x20;&#x20;

A basic framework to assess the maturity of the access to the e-services can be following:&#x20;

Level 1: Information exists electronically about the service.&#x20;

Level 2: One-way communication: Forms can be downloaded from the internet, to be filled in and submitted manually.&#x20;

Level 3: Two-way communication: Forms can be filled in and submitted online and the public service will be triggeredfor the authorized user.&#x20;

Level 4: Transaction: Services can be provided fully on-line by electronically submitting filled-in forms or data for processing. The output is also delivered electronically.&#x20;

Level 5: Personalized service: The entire service can be performed online, automatically,and proactively&#x20;
