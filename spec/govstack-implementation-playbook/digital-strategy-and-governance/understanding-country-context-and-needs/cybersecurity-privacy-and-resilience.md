# Cybersecurity, Privacy and Resilience

The reliability of ICT infrastructure is critical for building a digital government. Nevertheless, cybersecurity, privacy, and resilience go hand in hand in ensuring the proper government public service delivery and the trust towards their use.&#x20;

The ITU Global Cybersecurity Index is a trusted reference that measures the commitment of countries to cybersecurity at a global level to raise awareness of the importance and different dimensions of the issue and assess countriesâ€™ ICT sector resilience and reliability. It can be used to understand the overall country's preparedness in this regard and highlight the country's strength areas, and areas of potential growth.&#x20;

Mapping of the relevant stakeholders regulating and enforcing the legislation in this domain, as well as a good understanding of their mandates and capabilities might be of significant support in further implementation of services and identification of the gaps that need to be addressed before the launch of new services.&#x20;

Some questions that can be asked in the assessment process are:&#x20;

Does the country have a national cybersecurity strategy?&#x20;

Does the country have national and/or government CERT and/or CERT networks?&#x20;

Are there existing incident response capabilities available in the country?&#x20;

Does the country have a data protection legal framework in place?&#x20;

Are there competent authorities to enforce the data protection legislation?&#x20;

Is there a clear definition of critical information infrastructure at the national level?&#x20;

Are the critical information infrastructure protection measures in place?&#x20;

&#x20;
