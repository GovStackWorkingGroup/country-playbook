# Cybersecurity, Privacy and Resilience

The reliability of ICT infrastructure is critical for building a digital government. Cybersecurity, privacy, and resilience go hand in hand in ensuring a reliable service delivery that fosters trust toward their use.

The ITU Global Cybersecurity Index is a renowned reference that measures the commitment of countries to cybersecurity at a global level to raise awareness of the importance and different dimensions of the issue and assess countriesâ€™ ICT sector resilience and reliability. It can be employed to understand the overall country's preparedness in this regard and highlight the country's strength areas, and areas of potential growth.

Mapping the relevant stakeholders regulating and enforcing the legislation in this domain, as well as gaining a good understanding of their mandates and capabilities, might be helpful to deliver services and identify the gaps that need to be addressed before the launch of new services.

Some questions that can be asked in the assessment process are:&#x20;

* Does the country have a national cybersecurity strategy?
* Does the country have national and/or government CERT and/or CERT networks?&#x20;
* Are there incident response mechanisms in the country?
* Does the country have a data protection legal framework in place?
* Are there competent authorities to enforce the data protection legislation?
* Is there a clear definition of critical information infrastructure at the national level?&#x20;
* Are the critical information infrastructure protection measures in place?
