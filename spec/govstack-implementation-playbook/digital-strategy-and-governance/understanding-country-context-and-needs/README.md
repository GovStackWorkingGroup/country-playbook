# Understanding country context and needs

## Readiness assessment

To advance on the GovStack implementation in the country, there is a need to provide a simple overview with clear narratives about the country’s capacity to digitally transform, and the various components contributing to this process.&#x20;

The assessment responds to this need by analyzing the current digital readiness of the public sector and provides stakeholders with a good understanding of the current digital situation in the country. It draws general findings in key areas and guides further activities for the development and implementation of strategic national documents and projects on digital transformation.&#x20;

The assessment may benefit from secondary research, including various publications of the GovStack founding partners, multiple resources provided by the development partners of the implementing country, as well as additional research in the form of questionnaires, meetings, and interviews.&#x20;

When following the GovStack country engagement journey, the minimum level of data needs to be gathered across all countries GovStack is collaborating with. While having an opportunity to collaborate with numerous partners who use different approaches in performing the readiness assessment, having the minimum required set of data will ensure proper monitoring and allow measuring the impact over time in the reference implementation countries. &#x20;

The assessment should also offer a solid base for advancing on the necessary steps in the process of digital service implementation. So, this exercise might be viewed through the lens of the framework put in place by the Government of Ukraine and presented below. It offers additional clarity on the importance of comprehensive analysis at the beginning of the journey and how it can affect further steps. &#x20;

The e-Governance Academy Digital Readiness Study provides the country’s stakeholders with a good understanding of their current digital situation and the recommendations it contains can be used as guidance for the development and implementation of strategic national documents and projects on digital transformation. According to the methodology, the assessment is conducted in five steps: Preliminary research; Digital Readiness Study questionnaire; Preparations for online data collection interviews; Conducting interviews with key stakeholders; Development of the Digital Readiness Study report.&#x20;

The report not only reviews the country’s current state of digital readiness in the specified focus areas and provides suggestions for the next steps, but also covers the minimum level of data required for embarking the country on the GovStack engagement journey.
