# Digital skills

For the journey towards governmental digital transformation it is indispensable to identify where the country and its administration currently stand with regards to digital skills. Such exercise of identifying  digital talent and talent gaps is an important preliminary step as the rest of the digitalisation process largely depends on its starting base. &#x20;

It is crucial and highly recommendable to lay an overall basis of digital mindset among the country's population e.g. through the inclusion of digital skills in education pathways for the civil society.&#x20;

In addition to equipping all citizens and also public officials with basic skills, government entities need ICT experts with advanced IT and project management skills to maintain ICT architecture, provide user support, manage ICT procurements, and implement the governmentâ€™s digital strategy. &#x20;

Such public officials/civil servants, Digital Transformation Project Managers, ICT specialists etc. should be involved in regular internal capacity strengthening measures to always be up to date regarding new technologies and to be able to continuously foster a digital society.&#x20;

As an organization progresses through each stage of implementation, it is recommendable to establish a digital talent archive which provides support for the workforce in the long run. ([Cite](https://ega.ee/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kenya-Digital-Readiness-Study.pdf))&#x20;

&#x20;

In the following, guiding questions are presented that can support the analysis of the country's digital skills' status quo:&#x20;

&#x20;

*   Education sector&#x20;

    * Are digital skills and ICT in education clearly defined priorities in different strategic policy papers? If so, is this approach to digital skills development integrated and effective implementation being ensured?&#x20;
    * Is internet connectivity, electricity, teacher training and information security ensured to set the base for comprehensive ICT literacy within the education system?&#x20;
    * Is there a clear alignment and cooperation between what is offered at universities and demanded by the market (cooperation with ICT sector representatives to update the curricula with modern skills needed in the market; flexibility to change curricula according to market needs, incentives for internships, etc.)?&#x20;
    * Are Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs in place and the attraction of such for the civil society a priority of the government? &#x20;

    &#x20;
* General public&#x20;
  * Are Digital Skills Programmes launched to provide digital literacy? If so, does this include computer and internet training, awareness-raising of information literacy and tips for better protection of personal data (cyber hygiene)?&#x20;
  * Do (good) examples of public-private partnerships exist to increase the number of skilled ICT-experts?&#x20;
  * Are ICT skills audit being conducted to identify gaps in public sector digital skills and mindset?&#x20;
