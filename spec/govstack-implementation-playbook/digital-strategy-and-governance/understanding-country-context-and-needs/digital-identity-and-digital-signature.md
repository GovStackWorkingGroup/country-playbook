# Digital identity and digital signature

Digital identity and digital signatures are the core components of public service development. Government services heavily depend on the users’ ability to identify themselves simply and securely. Thus, governments aiming to be digital and user-centric opt for providing citizens with one or multiple ways to authenticate themselves while accessing government services. These can include digital ID, mobile ID, digital signature, etc. &#x20;

Most of these tools are functioning based on Public Key Infrastructure that consists of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.
