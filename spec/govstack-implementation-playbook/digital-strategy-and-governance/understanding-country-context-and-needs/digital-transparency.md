# Digital Transparency

Digital transparency is often expected to automatically appear during the initiated shift to a digitalized governance. While digitalized approach definitely eases up data’s transferring, storing, analyzing and archiving as it is now clear when and how it was processed, it does not equal to a transparent cycle and clear oversight over citizens’ data, accountability and access levels. Readiness to digitize the government has to follow with a readiness to disclose information about how the government operates, shares, restricts and removes citizens’ data on their systems. Such an approach has to motivate governments to act in the public interest and think of a way how to promote data’s full transparency cycle. Digital transparency is a quite vague definition, therefore we recommend assessing the digital transparency level with the following questions below:&#x20;

&#x20;

1\.     Do you ensure that collected data stays unaltered and its history can be traced?&#x20;

2\.     Do you have assigned stewards responsible for digital transparency?&#x20;

3\.     Do citizens get electronically notified, when the data regarding themselves has been gathered, viewed or processed?&#x20;

4\.     Do citizens have a possibility to govern the openness of their own data in a public database?&#x20;

5\.     Do public servants have data access limitations with respect to their tasks and area of responsibility?&#x20;

6\.     Do you have feedback mechanisms for improving transparency?&#x20;
