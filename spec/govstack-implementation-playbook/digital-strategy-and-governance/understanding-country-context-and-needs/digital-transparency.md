# Digital Transparency

Digital transparency is often taken for granted in the shift toward digitalized governance. While digitalized approaches usually ease up data’s transferring, storing, analyzing, and archiving – as it is now clear when and how it was processed – it does not necessarily mean that a transparent cycle with clear oversight over citizens’ data, accountability and access levels are in place. Digital readiness is intertwined with readiness to disclose information about how the government operates, shares, restricts and removes citizens’ data on their systems. Such an approach requires governments to act in the public interest and think of a way to promote a fully transparent data cycle. While it might be hard to directly observe and measure digital transparency, we recommend assessing digital transparency levels with the questionnaire below:

&#x20;

1\.     Do you ensure that collected data stays unaltered and its history can be traced?&#x20;

2\.     Do you have assigned stewards responsible for digital transparency?&#x20;

3\.     Do citizens get electronically notified when the data regarding themselves has been gathered, viewed, or processed?&#x20;

4\.     Do citizens have the possibility to govern the openness of their own data in a public database?&#x20;

5\.     Do public servants have data access limitations with respect to their tasks and area of responsibility?&#x20;

6\.     Do you have feedback mechanisms for improving transparency?&#x20;
