# Service prioritization and ranking

Definition of which services digitize first varies country from country. Before the prioritization and ranking stage, a country must identify a set of services that are part of its digital agenda. These may be outlined in policy documents such as a country's Digital Strategy/Agenda, Digital Roadmap, and National Development Plan, and co-selected with the participation of Ministries and stakeholders of the digital ecosystem in the Country/State/Municipality.&#x20;

Prioritization criteria shall be based on data gathered from Request for Information Forms (RFI) through RFI, II, III, & IV to rank services to work with according to the impact & feasibility of implementation.  Implementation will therefore be guided by the previous analysis, starting with services that are of the highest importance and highest feasibility, followed by those with high importance but low feasibility.&#x20;

The criteria presented in this playbook is a reference criterion. Each country can calibrate current criterion according to information availability, context & needs.  &#x20;

Once information has been gathered and validated with different service owners strategic services will be accommodated in a matrix (see figure XX) format to facilitate clustering and ranking (figure XX).
