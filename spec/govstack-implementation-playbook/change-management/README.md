# Change Management

## Innovation Management and Change Management

Traditionally, the world of innovation management and change management have followed different paths. One of the reasons for this is certainly that work on innovation management has most often been carried out by research and development specialists (acquiring this skills mainly at the universities) keeping scientific and technical profiles, while work on change management has been carried out by management consultants or professors (acquiring this skills in the universities too in the case of social sciences, but vey often in post degree courses or at Business Schools) supporting Human Resources Departments.  This can be a common approach for almost all types of organisations, but in the case of Public Administrations only recently the change management has been incorporated as a relevant issue to Masters in Public Policy and Masters in Public Administration programs.

At the present approaches to innovation (OCDE Oslo Manual rev5. 2018), organizational innovations including change management are clearly placed in addition to innovations in products, processes and services. In this sense qualitative studies (OECD, 2015b) concludes data collection should obtain information on the digital competences of orgnisations as a key component of their innovation capabilities.
