# Change Management

## Innovation Management and Change Management

Traditionally, the world of innovation management and change management have followed different paths. This is due in part to the fact that research and development specialists, who typically have scientific and technical backgrounds and receive their training at universities, tend to focus on innovation management. Meanwhile, change management has traditionally been the domain of management consultants or professors, who acquire their skills through university courses or post-degree training programs, often in Business Schools, to support Human Resources departments. Although this approach is common in many organizations, it is only recently that change management has been recognized as a relevant issue in Masters in Public Policy and Masters in Public Administration programs.

At present, approaches to innovation as outlined in the [OECD Oslo Manual rev5. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264304604-en) include organizational innovations such as change management, in addition to innovations in products, processes and services. In this sense qualitative studies such as the [OECD, 2015b's](https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264239012-en) report suggest that data collection should focus on digital competences of organizations, as this is a key component of their innovation capabilities.
