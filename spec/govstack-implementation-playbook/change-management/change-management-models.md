# Change Management Models

## Change models and digital change

At a conceptual level there is little that is truly new about how governments adopt digital change, as compared with other kinds of change. Different types of change can be (and have been) theorised in various diverse ways, from Kurt Lewin's change model (1947) through to Mark Moore's strategic triangle (1995) or John Kotter (1995). In the period of 1900 to 1945 started the First studies on Change Management. In the period from 1945 to 1990 were improved the Understanding of the mechanisms associated to change. Between 1990 and 2000 were stablished as an academic discipline which progressed first deepening and modelling concepts and tools from 2000 to 2010, and then targeting the improvement of internal capacities of the persons, teams and organisations.

There are numerous accounts and studies of attempts to bring about digital era change in governments around the world. There are already available powerful tools that can be deployed when attempting to overcome the range of barriers already outlined. Their knowledge and effective use in the practice forms part of the competencies needed for the people participating in the digitisation journey, in particular with managerial responsibilities or innovation and change management processes.

There is no single generalisable model about how to bring about significant digital change in governments. There are competing ideas about 'what matters most', and we still away from having clarity on the 'winners', but there are some generalizable insights which can be projected for similar contexts, as geographic, cultural or sectorial interests.

Digital era government is not just about developing new practices and capabilities. There exists a larger question of high new practices and technologies will cause a rethinking of how government institutions are structured and managed. The nature of digital transformation that governments want to implement doesn´t scape the theories of change towards a 'digital government as a platform' approach, and forms part of the digitisation journey.

### Models of strategic change management

There are many theories about how to manage change. The theories given by Kotter, Prosci, Lewis and others are milestones of the research on change management. Their theories have helped in thorough understanding the nature of change and to cope with it ideally without disturbing the working of the organization. The identify the need for change and assess the driving factors.

{% tab title="Lewin's framework of change (1947)" %}
The programme of planned change and improved performance developed by Lewin involves the management of a three-phase process of behaviour modification.

The associated framework shows how organizations and their routines need to be "unfrozen " first, in order to prepare the organization for the coming changes, reducing those forces which behaviour in its present form, recognition of the need for change and improvement to occur.

During the second phase, Movement – Development of new attitudes or behaviour and the implementation of change. Their might be restraining forces that are contradicting the change process and work against the driving forces for change.

In the last phase, after the change process has been moved through the organization, the new routines and procedures are frozen again. Ideally stabilising change at the new level and reinforcement (Hardy 1996)

{% tab title="Implementation of organizational change" %}
The second change framework refers to the three phases of change (prepare, manage and reinforce change). This framework is closely aligned with the previous framework and is oftentimes used in practice:

{% tab title="Eight steps to transforming an organization (Kotter.J, 1995)" %}
The following eight steps in the change process are his contribution.

> * Establishing a sense of urgency
> * Forming a powerful guiding coalition
> * Creating a vision
> * Communicating the vision
> * Empowering others to act on the vision
> * Planning and creating short term wins
> * Consolidating improvements and producing still more change
> * Institutionalising new approaches

_Kotter’s research gave a whole new way to managing change._

A new culture should be created within the organization such that managers look to change as an opportunity and adapt their business system to continuously emerging conditions. (Hussey 2000)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Prosci’s ADKAR" %}
Effective change management demands five key goals to form the basic ADKAR model:

> * Awareness of the need to change
> * Desire to participate and support the change
> * Knowledge of how to change (and what change looks like)
> * Ability to implement the change on a day-to-day basis
> * Reinforcement to keep the change in place (Hiatt 2003)

5 tenets emerge from the Prosci´s ADKAR model and assessment tools:

> * Tenet 1: We change for a reason
> * Tenet 2: Organizational change requires individual change
> * Tenet 3: Organizational outcomes are the collective result of individual change
> * Tenet 4: Change management is an enabling framework for managing the people side of change
> * Tenet 5: We apply change management to realize the benefits and desired outcomes of change

{% tab title="GovStack model approach to Change Management" %}
As practical result, our GovStack model approach to Change Management includes 6 key stages:

> 1. Set goals
> 2. Make a diagnosis
> 3. Identify profiles
> 4. Defining the strategy
> 5. Driving the change
> 6. Consolidate change
