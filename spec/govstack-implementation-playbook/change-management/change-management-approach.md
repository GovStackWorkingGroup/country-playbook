# Change Management Approach

## Change Management

The Digital Journey implies a holistic effort to rethink and change the core processes of government beyond the traditional digitization efforts in government. It evolves along a continuum from the use of working methods and relations with the citizens, changes in IT contracting practices to organizational change efforts that involve the whole ecosystem of the organization. Change management can be defined as the methods and manners in which an organisation describes and implements change within both its internal and external processes.

It is a discipline for managing not only the technical but also the people side of change. In this sense Change management is not just a tool for managing resistance against change reactively. It is most effective as a tool for activating and engaging stakeholders, and in particular employees, in a change.

Managing change can be tough, but part of the problem is that there is little agreement on what factors most influence transformation initiatives.

## Barriers to change: soft and hard factors

In the course of the last years, many change management specialists have focused on soft issues, such as culture, communication, leadership, and motivation. Such elements are certainly important for success but managing these aspects alone can´t be enough for an effective implementation of transformative projects, as the case of those needed within the digitalisation journey.

Soft factors influence the outcomes of change programs and projects. Visionary[ leadership](https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-to-develop-your-leadership-style) is often vital for transformation projects, but not always becomes a key aspect. The same can be said about communication with stakeholders, or change attitudes or relationships within the teams or the organisations. Furthermore, these aspects, as well as culture or motivation levels are not always easy to be transformed into reliable data.

Change management is also related to the hard factors. These factors bear three distinct characteristics. First, organisations must be able to measure them in direct or indirect ways. Second, should be able to communicate and share their importance, both internally and externally. Third, and perhaps most important, organisations must be able of reacting and influencing those elements quickly. Some of the hard factors that affect a transformation initiative are the time necessary to complete it, the number of people required to execute it, and the availability of the associated financial aspects.

[Sound research](https://hbr.org/2005/10/the-hard-side-of-change-management) shows that change projects fail to get off the ground when organisations neglect the hard factors. This implies that in parallel with the soft elements we will treat in this chapter, the organisations must pay attention to the hard issues too.

We can anticipate the most common barriers we will encounter within real government bureaucracies when trying to deploy the digital journey. This will allow to identify and add digital era skills to the stakeholders participating in the change. There appear worldwide relevant similarities among the most common types of barriers we can find when trying to bring about change (both digital and non-digital) in the organisations, and in particular within governments. This implies soft and hard factors related:

* Legal
* Budgetary
* Technical (including energy efficiency and environmental aspects)
* Procurement
* Cultural
* Psychological
* Auditing
* Human resources

It is important for the public servants of being able to overcome these barriers to the delivery of successful digital era public services. In this sense it is possible to use already existent or to create new solutions to help overcome barriers to digital era change in a government context.

&#x20;Resistance to change in the digital era combines timeless causes with new ones that are specific to modern technologies.

Digital era change has come to governments through mechanisms most of which were well established long before the digital revolution.
