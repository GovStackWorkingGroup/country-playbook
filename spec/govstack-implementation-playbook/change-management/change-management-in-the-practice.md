# Change Management in the Practice

There are some basic questions about Change management which emerge in practice from the referred models:

<details>

<summary>Do change management right the first time (or at least try to do)</summary>

Although resistance is a normal human response to change, we should avoid or mitigate a significant amount of resistance by applying effective [change management](https://www.prosci.com/change-management) from the start of a project or initiative.

Participants in Prosci’s 2019 benchmarking study indicated that 47% of the employee resistance they encountered could have avoided by implementing effective change management practices and principles. The moral here is: If you do adopt a Change Management Action Plan right the first time, you can [prevent much of the resistance](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/managing-resistance-to-change) from occurring.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Expect resistance to change</summary>

Actions for addressing and mitigating resistance include:

* Actions for addressing and mitigating resistance include:
* Utilizing a structured change management approach from the design of the project
* Engaging senior leaders as [active and visible sponsors](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/primary-sponsors-role-and-importance) of the change
* Recruiting support from people managers as advocates for the change
* Communicating the need for change, its impacts on individuals, and the benefits to employees

</details>

<details>

<summary>Address resistance formally</summary>

Sources of resistance include:

* Employees who are highly invested in the current way of doing work
* People who created the current way of doing work that will be changed
* Employees who expect more work as a result of the change        &#x20;
* Those who advocated a particular alternative, (e.g., they wanted Option B, but Option A was selected)        &#x20;
* People who have been very successful and rewarded in the current way of doing work&#x20;

These groups of stakeholders, with a clear relevance in the case of Public Administrations, are likely sources of resistance and should be addressed proactively in the entire project lifecycle with targeted tactics for mitigating these objectio

<details>

<summary>Identify the root causes of resistance</summary>

Among several root causes, it appears:

* Lack of awareness of why the change was being made&#x20;
* Impact on current job role        &#x20;
* Fear rooted in uncertainty due to past failed changes        &#x20;
* Lack of visible support from and trust in management or leadership        &#x20;
* Lack of inclusion in the change

</details>

<details>

<summary>Engage the “right” resistance managers and reinforce positively and proactively team building</summary>

Managers have five unique and important [roles to play](https://blog.prosci.com/5-key-roles-for-people-managers-in-leading-change) during times of change:

* Communicator        &#x20;
* Liaison –project team        &#x20;
* Advocate support for the change        &#x20;
* Resistance Manager –mitigate resistance to the change        &#x20;
* Coach – supporting employees through the change process&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Ensure the appropriate management and leadership </summary>

Basically, leadership refers to the influence and position of the individual as a leader within his group or team. A successful leader is distinguished by their ability to inspire and lead their team to achieve common goals. The definition of leadership involves qualities such as self-confidence, exemplarity, open-mind and the ability to manage challenges and crises within the organisation.

&#x20;There are 11 types of leadership commonly accepted for classification:

1. Authoritarian (or autocratic)
2. Participatory (or democratic)
3. Laissez-faire (or delegative)
4. Visionary
5. Coaching-Based
6. Affiliative (or collaborative)
7. Democratic (but also very limited by the timing) leadership
8. Lead
9. Directive
10. Transformational leadership&#x20;
11. Transactional Leadership

<summary>Take care about the motivation of the stakeholder</summary>

There is no single motivation theory that explains all aspects of human motivation, but these theoretical explanations do often serve as the basis for the development of approaches and techniques to increase motivation in distinct areas of human endeavour. In this sense, Change Management affects and is affected by the human behaviour.

#### 4 Different types of motivation

The [self-concordance model](https://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/PGSG/Sheldon%2001%20self-concord%20happy%20copy.pdf) of goal setting differentiates between four types of motivation (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999). These are:

* External motivation
* Introjected motivation
* Identified motivation
* Intrinsic motivation

#### Content Theories of Motivation

Are mainly focused on what motivates people and addressed specific factors like individual needs and goals

* Maslow’s theory of the hierarchy of needs
* Alderfer’s ERG theory
* McClelland’s achievement motivation theory
* Herzberg’s two-factor theory

### **Change management tools**

Operational and practical tools are well known and usually used by the practitioners of Change Management,  complementing those traditional of Project Management. In many cases They are based in several of the models and methodologies already mentioned.

Some toolkits are better suited to [policymakers](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_discipline-or-practice=digital-transformation&\_sft\_user-type=policy-maker-or-adviser) or [managers](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_discipline-or-practice=digital-transformation&\_sft\_user-type=manager) overseeing a digital transformation initiative or portfolio while other toolkits are better suited to [practitioners](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_discipline-or-practice=digital-transformation&\_sft\_user-type=practitioner) doing the tactical digital transformation work.

Some toolkits touch on skills and behaviours important for digital transformations. Skills and team formation is important, so browse toolkits that reference [team formation](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_good-for=build-a-team) or [collaboration](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_good-for=collaboration)

&#x20;Main tools used in Change Management (Graphics):

* The mourning curve
* Force Field Analysis
* Equation of change
* Leavitt's Diamond
* Burke and Litwin model
* Futures Wheel
* William Bridge's transitional model
* The socio-dynamic grid of actors
