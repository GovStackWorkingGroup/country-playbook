# Change Management in the Practice

There are some basic questions about Change management which emerge in practice from the referred models in the previous section:

<summary>Change Management Questions</summary>

1. _**Do change management right the first time (or at least try to do)**_

Although resistance is a normal human response to change, we should avoid or mitigate a significant amount of resistance by applying effective [change management](https://www.prosci.com/change-management) from the start of a project or initiative.

Participants in [Prosci’s 2019 benchmarking study](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/tips-for-managing-resistance-to-change) indicated that 47% of the employee resistance they encountered could have been avoided by implementing effective change management practices and principles. The moral here is: If you do adopt a Change Management Action Plan right the first time, you can [prevent much of the resistance](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/managing-resistance-to-change) from occurring.

2. _**Expect resistance to change (at all the levels and through all the process until full completion of the targeted phase)**_

Actions for addressing and mitigating resistance include:

* Actions for addressing and mitigating resistance include
* Utilizing a structured change management approach from the design of the project
* Engaging senior leaders as [active and visible sponsors](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/primary-sponsors-role-and-importance) of the change
* Recruiting support from people managers as advocates for the change
* Communicating the need for change, its impacts on individuals, and the benefits to employees

3. _**Address resistance formally (both directly and indirectly)**_

Sources of resistance include:

* Employees who are deeply invested in the current way of doing work
* Individuals who designed the current way of doing work that will be modified
* Employees who anticipate an increase in their workload as a result of the change        &#x20;
* Individuals who advocated a particular alternative that was not selected, (for instance, they preferred Option B, but Option A was selected)        &#x20;
* Individuals who have been very successful and rewarded in the current way of doing work&#x20;

In the case of Public Administrations, these stakeholder groups are particularly relevant and may present potential sources of resistance. Therefore, it is important to proactively address them throughout the project lifecycle by implementing targeted tactics to mitigate these resistance.

4. _**Identify the root causes of resistance (and prioritise the actions)**_

In the context of organizational change, it appears that among several root causes for resistance, the following factors play a significant role:

* Lack of awareness of why the change was necessary&#x20;
* Concerns about the impact of the change on current job role and responsibilities        &#x20;
* Fear based on past experiences of failed changes, leading to uncertainty about the outcome of the current change      &#x20;
* Lack of visible support from and trust in management or leadership        &#x20;
* Lack of inclusion in the change process

5. _**Engage the “right” resistance managers and reinforce positively and proactively team building (both at the elaboration and the implementation phases of the Change Management Action Plan)**_

Managers have five unique and important [roles to play](https://blog.prosci.com/5-key-roles-for-people-managers-in-leading-change) during times of change:

* Communicator        &#x20;
* Liaison – project team        &#x20;
* Advocate support for the change        &#x20;
* Resistance Manager –mitigate resistance to the change        &#x20;
* Coach – supporting employees through the change process

6. _**Ensure the appropriate management and leadership (is not the same)**_

Basically, leadership refers to the influence and position of the individual as a leader within his group or team. A successful leader is distinguished by their ability to inspire and lead their team to achieve common goals. The definition of leadership involves qualities such as self-confidence, exemplarity, open-mind and the ability to manage challenges and crises within the organisation.

&#x20;There are 11 types of leadership commonly accepted for classification:

1. Authoritarian (or autocratic)
2. Participatory (or democratic)
3. Laissez-faire (or delegative)
4. Visionary
5. Coaching-Based
6. Affiliative (or collaborative)
7. Democratic (but also very limited by the timing) leadership
8. Lead
9. Directive
10. Transformational leadership&#x20;
11. Transactional Leadership

7. _**Take care about the motivation of the stakeholder**_

While no single theory can fully explain human motivation, various theoretical explanations serve as the foundation for developing approaches and techniques to enhance motivation in different areas of human endeavor.&#x20;

#### There are 4 Different types of motivation

The [self-concordance model](https://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/PGSG/Sheldon%2001%20self-concord%20happy%20copy.pdf) of goal setting differentiates between four types of motivation (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999). These are:

* External motivation
* Introjected motivation
* Identified motivation
* Intrinsic motivation

#### Content Theories of Motivation

Are mainly focused on what motivates people and addressed specific factors like individual needs and goals

* Maslow’s theory of the hierarchy of needs
* Alderfer’s ERG theory
* McClelland’s achievement motivation theory
* Herzberg’s two-factor theory

In this sense, human behavior plays a significant role in both the impact of and response to Change Management.

### **Change Management Tools**

Operational and practical tools are well known and usually used by the practitioners of Change Management,  complementing those traditional of Project Management. In many cases they are based in several of the models and methodologies already mentioned.

Some toolkits are better suited to [policymakers](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_discipline-or-practice=digital-transformation&\_sft\_user-type=policy-maker-or-adviser) or [managers](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_discipline-or-practice=digital-transformation&\_sft\_user-type=manager) overseeing a digital transformation initiative or portfolio while other toolkits are better suited to [practitioners](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_discipline-or-practice=digital-transformation&\_sft\_user-type=practitioner) doing the tactical digital transformation work.

Some toolkits touch on skills and behaviours important for digital transformations. Skills and team formation is important, so browse toolkits that reference [team formation](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_good-for=build-a-team) or [collaboration](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/?\_sft\_good-for=collaboration).

**Main tools used in Change Management:**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="The mourning curve" %}
It schematically represents the different stages intrinsic to any change that any individual experiences before accepting the new situation and living it fully: shock/denial, anger/fear, sadness/depression, the search for meaning and serenity.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Force Field Analysis" %}
Implemented by Kurt Lewin, this matrix makes it possible to analyze the different forces - positive AND negative - in the face of a blockage in order to allow it to be unblocked: rectify the situation, reconsider - even sometimes abandon - an overambitious idea/project proving far too complex to implement in view of the reluctance thus listed:

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Equation of Change" %}
Popularized by Richard Beckhard and Reuben T. Harris, this tool makes it possible to conduct a precise analysis of a given situation by studying the different conditions and possibilities relating to any transformation.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Leavitt's Diamond" %}
This is a very interesting tool for identifying and measuring the impacts that a change can have at all levels of the company.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Burke and Litwin model" %}
This tool makes it possible to analyse and evaluate the organizational and environmental dimensions necessary for successful change: identify the cause and effect links between the different dimensions and allows to make adjustments aiming to improving performance.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Futures Wheel" %}
This tool allows the collective visualization, analysis and exploration of the direct and indirect consequences of a change, event, problem or even a tendency.
