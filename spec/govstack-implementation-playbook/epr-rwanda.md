# EPR, Rwanda

## The problem

Improper disposal of e-waste poses numerous threats to the environment, economy, and health and well-being of citizens. Rwanda wanted to implement a legally transparent, digitally supported, and appropriately financed EPR digital service for the management of e-waste.

## What are we doing

1. Completion of EPR regulatory framework for e-waste management in Rwanda
2. Co-designing the EPR digital service based on user needs, journeys and business life events
3. Co-designing the financial mechanism

## Where we are in the process

## What we expect Rwanda to achieve

**A forward-looking e-waste regulation that will allow electronic producers to finance the collection**, **recycling** and end-of-life **disposal** of e-waste equipment/product streams - batteries, small consumer electronics, accumulators, packaging and other EPR product categories - in order to mitigate the environmental impacts of their products throughout the entire product life cycle.&#x20;
