# Understand user needs & map 'as-is' / 'initial to-be' user journey

Understanding who are we solving a problem for is important for creating a user-centric mindset within a digital service team  and build empathy and motivation for digital service design work. If there is a design lead on your team, they will likely lead this work, but the entire service team should be closely involved.&#x20;

Once we know who our service users are, we need to understand how they are currently “getting the job done” or how their needs are currently being met. This is achieved by developing the 'As-Is' user journey (if the service is already in place) or an '[initial to-be](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJNVyjg=/?share\_link\_id=546357928944)' user journey (If it is an entirely new service).&#x20;

Observational and structured research will help you hear what users say they like or dislike about their current state. Using a [design thinking](../3-terminology.md#design-thinking) mindset to translate user feedback into underlying goals and problems will allow to identify problems and solutions the users may not have thought to articulate.&#x20;

In addition, no process, service, or product lives in a vacuum, so we want to understand how these fit together to impact the overall user experience. This can be understood in detail through the use of [User/Business Life event map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3). Past efforts and solutions will offer useful lessons to refine the understanding of what works and doesn’t work.&#x20;

Involvement from all partners and users participating along the journey is needed to complete their view of the current state of the service and/or what the users need.  Co-developing a shared baseline of where you are starting from is a necessary input for the following steps within the process of designing and delivering a digital service.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
Start by understanding user needs. This requires:

* Defining the key users of the current process&#x20;
* Empathizing with the users and gathering context of their day-to-day activities, objectives, and goals&#x20;
* Describing the key steps and activities in their current process and identifing their pain points&#x20;
* Demonstrating how users interact or depend on each other in order to achieve success&#x20;
* Organizing individual users into groups, if required&#x20;
* Distinguishing between the users
* &#x20;most affected or impacted by the current process and those with a more peripheral interest
* Map the service within the [User/Business Life event map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
The following actions are recomended in gaining a thorough understanding of  user needs and mapping of a detailed user journey throughout various co-designing sessions (with users).&#x20;

* Work with the service [design lead](../annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy.md#design-lead) (if you have one in the team) and other team members to create a research plan. Determine what you want to learn, what methods you’ll use, and who will participate.&#x20;
* Map out the current user journey end-to-end, identifying the key actors involved, the activities they are doing, their goals, and the tools or systems they are using, as well as how this process fits into their daily life. You can use GovStack [user journey template](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5) for this task and adjust it according to your research plan. &#x20;
* Map out critical decisions or steps that result in branches in the current process in the 'As-Is' / '[Initial to-be](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5)' user journey.
* Identify explicit and implicit pain points and opportunities, including emotional pain points, functional blockers, and/or common drop-off rates or moments of failure.&#x20;
* Map service within the [User/Business Life event map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3) to understand the origins of data from services which are a prerequisit to the service. Also, understand how the service in question impacts other services within the User/Business Life event map.
* Debrief after each session and adjust your research plan as needed.&#x20;
* Validate qualitative findings with quantitative data when possible, you can use [RFI II – Service Catalogue & Systems](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-2-rfi-2) to gather quantitative data across the different services involve in the user journey. &#x20;
* Ask the service owner if there have been any previous efforts in digitising the service, and seek out any resulting reports, findings, or raw data.&#x20;
* Analyze and synthesize your findings with the service team, with the objective of identifying patterns related to service. For example, prior to each summer, there is a significant spike for pasport applications, this is a patern that allows to prepare in advance for this increase in demand for the service.
* Depending on the complexity of the service, you can request alignment from business leads on initial prioritization to focus additional research activities.
* Up-dating [glossary for roles](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy), workflows, organizational entity responsable for each step within a user journey.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital team" %}
Who does what:

* Service designers/ Design lead – Lead the activites within the 'Activities' Tab.
* User needs researchers – Prepare & conduct user interviews, focus groups, facilitate user journey workshops &#x20;
* Legal advisors – Clarify regulations that apply to the service &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}
* Research plan &#x20;
* As-Is user journey &#x20;
* [User/Business Life event Map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3)
* [Findings & recommendations report](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#findings-and-recommendations-report) (Should include qualitative & quantitative findings) .
* Who is who report &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Next steps" %}
What to do next:

* Present the "as-is" / "[Initial to-be](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5)" user journey with qualitative & quantitative findings to organizational stakeholders to build empathy around the current state.&#x20;
* Translate your findings into preliminary recommendations or decision points around the problems and use cases to support.&#x20;
* Draw on your research to help your team articulate a concise problem statement, create an inspirational vision, and develop a strategy for achieving their desired [future state](https://product-guide.18f.gov/define/).&#x20;
