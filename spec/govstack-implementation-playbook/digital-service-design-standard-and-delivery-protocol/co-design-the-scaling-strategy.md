# Co-design the scaling strategy

Based on previous steps in the Digital Sevice Desing Standards and Delivery Protocal, digital teams can iterate the process and streamline the process of identifying critical Building Blocks that must be added to the National stack. These Building Blocks will enable further digitisation of prioritised services. The country must set targets within a roadmap to digise 100% of governemnt services. This will involve, improving currently digitised services, digitising new services from the prioritisation list and identifying new services that provide value to their users.

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A good co-designed scaling strategy requires:

* Having a complete service catalogue with information on each service, which includes, level of digitisation, demand, number of interactions to complete the service among other data that can facilitate optimisation and prioritisation of services according to the impact and feasibility of digitsing the services. (use of [RFI-II](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-2-rfi-2) recomended).&#x20;
* A user/buisness life evnet map that gives an understanding of how services are related to one another.
* A detailed digitisation roadmap that indicates the number of services to be digitised each year according to the user needs, user journeys and life events using the Building Block approach
* Publicaly accessable dashboard that showcases the strategy, progress made on the roadmap, perforance indicators on each service and current country stack and generic workflows.
* Comprehensive bylaws that puts the roadmap in effect. The follwoing are a few of these bylaws:
  * Digital Service Standard and Delivery Protocol,
  * Enterprise architecture,&#x20;
  * Shared service policy, and
  * ICT procurement policy
* A systems catalgue to identify resuable software components that can suport digitisation of services.
* A complete set of Building Blocks required to digitise the catalogue of sevices.
* Having a capacity building stratey for all public servents involved in the digitisation of services.
* Having a thoughtful and practical digital inclusion strategy.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
The following actions are to take place in co-design sessions with service stakeholders to develop a scaling strategy:&#x20;

* Establishing the digital service teams within each government entity to:
  * Participate in the co-design sessions of the scalling strategy
  * Lead the implementation of digitistion roadmap within each entity
* Define the structure of catalogue of services. Use of RFI-II to assist in Cataloguing the services
* Classify the catalogued services on the basis of their level of digitisation:
  * Level 1- Informative: Information on the service is made available online yet the actual transaction happens in-person.&#x20;
  * Level 2- Downloadable forms: The users can download and complete the forms, while having to submit the same forms in-person or uploading the documents.
  * Level 3- Submission of webform: Users can validate data showcased on the webform, upload the required documents and fill out forms and submit them remotely.
  * Level 4: 100% online
* Map the services from the catalogue on the User/Business Life evnet map.
* Prioritise and rank the catalogued services on the basis of their impact and feasibility of digitsation.
* Agree on a set of services shortlisted to be digitised each year by govenment entities using the Building Block approach.
* Develop the systems catalgue to identify resuable software components that can suport digitisation of services.
* Identify missing Building Blocks that are critical in buidling the national stack.&#x20;
* Definie the approach to adding the missing Building Blocks within the national stack, either through tendering, developing indigenously or re-using exisiting Building Blocks listed in [DIAL's catalogue](https://solutions.dial.community/building\_blocks) or GovStack sandbox
* Co-design a comprehensive regulatory framework to make the roadmap of digitising services actionable. This framework will include:
  * Digital Service Standard and Delivery Protocol,
  * Enterprise architecture,&#x20;
  * Shared service policy, and
  * ICT procurement policy
* Develop a capacity building stratey for all public servants involved in the digitisation of services and a digital inclusion strategy.

* Digital teams of each governemnt entity
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Next steps" %}
* Public launch of  detailed digitisation roadmap.
* Followup on the implementation of roadmap
* Procurement/set-up of missing Building Blocks
