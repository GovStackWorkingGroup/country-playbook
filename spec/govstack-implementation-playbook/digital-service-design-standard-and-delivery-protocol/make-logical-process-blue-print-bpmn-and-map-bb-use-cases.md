# Make logical process blue print (BPMN) and map BB use cases

Once the  "to-be" user journey and white-frame protype has been approve by service owner.  It is time to coordinate with the product & technical team an initial product/technical co-design session. This aims to make a series of logical BPMN process blue prints to guide the technical design of the front & back end of the digital service by identifying BB use cases that will enable the approved white frame prototype. &#x20;

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
&#x20;A good initial product/technical co-design process...&#x20;

* Uses BPMN to map business process that will enable the approved white frame prototype&#x20;
* Details activities & transactions per role, as well as, organizational entity &#x20;
* Identifies digital public goods including building blocks to re-use & adapt from National Stack or GovStack Global&#x20;
* Identifies legacy systems to be used and/or integrated with&#x20;
* Identifies adaptors if need it (HL7 examples)  &#x20;
  * Protocol translation &#x20;
  * Format translation &#x20;
* Identifies data flows &#x20;
* Identify unique set up workflows &#x20;

How to get there



* Use the GovStack logical process blue print (BPMN) template &#x20;
* As you map BB use cases you can also identity priority BB use case to activate first &#x20;
* Select technology easy to adapt according to how user needs changes over time &#x20;
* Have an effective approach to managing any legacy technology the service integrates with or depends on&#x20;
* Use appropriate tools and technologies to create and operate a good service in a cost effective way - for example, by automating things where possible&#x20;
* Be able to show that they’ve made good decisions about what technology to build and what to buy&#x20;
* Understand total cost of ownership of the technology and preserve the ability to make different choices in the future - for example, reducing the chances of getting locked into contracts for specific tools and suppliers by using open standards&#x20;

Who does what&#x20;

* Service designer – Lead the service co-design journey&#x20;
* Business process analyst – Prepares BPMNs based on revised To-Be user journey and white frame prototype. In the GovStack approach this task is usually done by country digital teams, training on BPMN is provided as part of the GovStack LMS&#x20;
* Product/Tech experts  - Can be consulted in order to correctly map transactions coming for GovStack BB Use Cases or in Country legacy systems &#x20;

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}
* Business process diagrams in BPMN&#x20;
* Logical process blueprint (process narrative)&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Incorporation" %}
What to do next

* Present logical process blue print (BPMN) to service digital team &#x20;
* Gather feedback and iterate making sure the technical proposal complies with country ICT standards and enterprise architecture &#x20;
* Map integration requirements & cross building block interaction diagram&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Resources" %}
* LMS Modules: 1, 2, 3 &#x20;
* Use the GovStack  logical process blue print (BPMN) &#x20;
* Use the BB Use Case Catalogue&#x20;
