# Co-design "to-be" user journey

The "as-is"/"Initial To-Be" user journey along with its qualitative & quantitative findings enable you to run co-designing sessions with service community and relevant stakeholders. These co-designing sessions aim to improve the service and deliver a user friendly experience documented in form of a "to-be" user journey. [Co-design must be treated as a process rather than as a event. ](https://www.ncoss.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Codesign-principles.pdf)The following image describes the aforementioned co-design process.

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A good co-design process requires:

* Defining the key users of the ["to-be" journey](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-5-rfi-5).  These key users include citizens-business, public officials of the different entities that participate in the journey, and any stakeholder related to the service. &#x20;
* Describing the key steps and activities in their expected 'to-be' process &#x20;
* Identifing happy points (innovate in anticipating user needs)&#x20;
* Considering interoperability along the steps of the journey to reach the least viable number of touch points and a seamless experience. &#x20;
* Identifing access & delivery channels for the service – voice command, web, mobile app, sms, physical presence according to the service community context & needs &#x20;
* Identifing country legislation, policies & standards regulating the service that need to be updated to enable the 'To-Be' User journey.
* Identifing service components to be standardized. Standardisation inculcates familiarity with service users, allowing them to easily identify offecial forms/documents/resources and disregard forged ones:
  * [Service information sheet](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#information-service-sheets)
  * [Downloadable forms](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
  * [Web forms](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
  * [Electronic documents](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
  * [Notifications](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
  * [Performance analytics](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
  * [Citizen satisfaction survey](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
  * [Accessibility ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
The following actions are recomended when mapping detailed 'To-Be' user journey throughout various co-designing sessions.&#x20;

* Map out critical decisions or steps that result in branches in the to-be user journey. For example, user journeys brach on the basis of bylaws govering the service (new business registering a product that needs to comply with an e-waste regulation; existing business registering a new product that needs to comply with an e-waste regulation and businesses with product catalogues that already include prodcuts that need to comply with e-waste regulation) in case of EPR in Rwanda.
* Identify explicit and implicit happy points and opportunities to mitigate pain points, functional blockers, and/or common drop-off points or moments of failure.&#x20;
* Debrief after each session and adjust your co-design plan as needed.&#x20;
* Validate qualitative findings with quantitative data when possible, you can use [RFI II – Service Catalogue & Systems](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-2-rfi-2) to gather quantitative data across the different services involve in the user journey. &#x20;
* Synthesize and analyze your findings with your team, looking for patterns.&#x20;
* Identify theh service components that need to be standardised along the "to-be" user journey (service information sheet, downloadable forms, web forms, electronic documents, notifications, performance analytics, citizen satisfaction survey, accessibility)&#x20;
* Up-dating [glossary for roles](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy), workflows, organizational entity responsable for each step within the 'To-be' user journey. &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital team" %}
Who does what:

* [Service designers](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#service-designer) – Lead the service co-design journey&#x20;
* [User needs researchers](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#user-needs-researchers) – Prepare & apply user interviews, focus groups, facilitates user journey workshops &#x20;
* [Legal advisors](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#legal-policy-officer) – Clarify regulations that apply to the service &#x20;
* [UX/IU Designers](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#ux-ui-designers) – If the service under analysis is already online, UX/UI designers can join the co-design sessions to have firsthand interaction with the users &#x20;
* [Product/Tech experts](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#back-end-developers)  - If the service under analysis is already online  Product/Tech team members can join the co-design sessions to have firsthand interaction with the users &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}
* Co-design plan &#x20;
* To-be user journey &#x20;
* List of service components along the "to-be" user journey to be standardized (Information service sheets, downloadable forms, web forms, electronic documents, notifications, performance analytics, citizen satisfaction survey, accessibility)&#x20;
* Who is who report &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Next steps" %}
What to do next:

* Present the "to-be" user journey to the service community, and relevant stakeholders. &#x20;
* Incorporate last round of feedback gather from service community and relevant stakeholders presentations. &#x20;
* Develop a Wireframes and/or voice command flow of the service &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Resources" %}
* LMS Modules: [1](../learning-and-exchange/govstack-learning-management-system/#awareness-building-and-expression-of-interest),[2](../learning-and-exchange/govstack-learning-management-system/#agreement-of-cooperation),[3](../learning-and-exchange/govstack-learning-management-system/#govstack-internal-kick-off) &#x20;
* Use the Facilitation PPT for the "To-Be" user journey co-design sessions &#x20;
* Use the [GovStack user journey guideline  ](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5)
* Use the [GovStack "To-Be" user journey template (](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJNVyjg=/?share\_link\_id=546357928944)Explore the "To-Be" user journeys of Rwanda EPR Use Case[)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJNVyjg=/?share\_link\_id=546357928944) and adapted to your needs &#x20;
