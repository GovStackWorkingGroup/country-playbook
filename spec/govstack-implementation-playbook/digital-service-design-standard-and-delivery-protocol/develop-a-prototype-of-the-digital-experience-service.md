# Develop a prototype of the digital experience/service

Once we have learned more about users’ expectations and created a ''to-be'' user journey, it is time to create testable design. Sketching, [wireframing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnZrypOaVCg), and prototyping will help you ensure your service reflects your users’ needs. A prototype is a rudimentary version, either static or functional, of something that exhibits realistic form and function.&#x20;

Prototyping enables direct examination of a design concept’s viability with users. These prototypes (often paper or white frames) are helpful for gaining feedback on users’ intentions and various design elements. Functional prototypes (often coded) are helpful for observing how users interact with the product.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A good prototype process requires:

* Building on preliminary Lo-Fi [wireframes and/or voice command flow ](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow)that show structure, placement, and hierarchy for your service. &#x20;
* Steering clear of font choices, color, or other elements that would distract both the researcher and the reviewer. Lightweight designs are conceptually easier to reconfigure. Use this opportunity to start listing what UX/UI patterns you will need.&#x20;
* Reviewing [wireframes and/or voice command flows](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow) according to the specific 'To-be' user journey to ensure users accomplish their goles and their needs are meet.&#x20;
* Using the [wireframes and/or voice command flow](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow) to get the team’s feedback on feasibility and structure.&#x20;
* Using [wireframes and/or voice command flow](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow) as a way of safely trying out more radical ideas.   &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
The following actions are recomended in developing a prototype.&#x20;

* Create a preliminary version of the service using a [wireframes and/or voice command flow](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow)
* Give the [wireframes and/or voice command flow ](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow)to the user (Citizen/public servent /business) and public official user to observe their interactions without instruction.&#x20;
* After this observation, ask them to perform a specific task.&#x20;
* Ask clarifying questions about why they do what they do. Let the user’s behavior guide the questions you ask. It can be helpful to have them narrate their thought process as they go along.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital team" %}
Who does what&#x20;

* [Service designers](../annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy.md#service-designer)/ Design lead – Lead the activites within the 'Activities' Tab.
* [User needs researchers](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/) – Prepare & apply user interviews, focus groups, facilitates user journey workshops &#x20;
* [Legal policy officer](../annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy.md#legal-policy-officer)– Clarify regulations that apply to the service &#x20;
* [UX/IU Designers](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/zlgZ7XvqYnhGTNjlQo19/) – If the service under analysis is already online, UX/UI designers can join the co-design sessions to have firsthand interaction with the users &#x20;
* [Product/Tech experts](../annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy.md#back-end-developers)  - If the service under analysis is already online, Product/Tech team members can participate in the iteration session with users to see reaction to white-frame prototype &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}
* [Wireframes and/or voice command flow](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#wireframes-and-or-voice-command-flow) &#x20;
* List of service components along the "to-be" user journey to be standardized following the digital service standard applied across all government services. This includes:
  * Information service sheets:&#x20;
  * downloadable forms, web forms, electronic documents, notifications, performance analytics, citizen satisfaction survey, accessibility) &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Next steps" %}
What to do next

* Iterate! Prototypes should be quick and painless to create, and even more quick and painless to discard.&#x20;
* Get service owner approval to proceed with the functional prototype &#x20;
