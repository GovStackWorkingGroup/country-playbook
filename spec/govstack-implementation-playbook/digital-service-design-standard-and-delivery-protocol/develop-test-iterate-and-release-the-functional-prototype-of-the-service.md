# Develop, test, iterate & release the functional prototype of the service

Once we set up the sandbox environment, we are ready to start developing and orchestrating a functional prototype of the service. Test it against the business blue print and integration requirements and iterate it with the technical team and users to gather feedback.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A good functional prototype of the service …

* Complies with the approved 'To-be user journey' and wireframes
* Complies to Country digital service design standards:&#x20;
  * Information service sheets,&#x20;
  * Downloadable forms, &#x20;
  * Web forms, &#x20;
  * Electronic documents, &#x20;
  * Notifications, &#x20;
  * Performance analytics, &#x20;
  * Citizen satisfaction survey, &#x20;
  * Accessibility &#x20;
* Complies with business logical blueprint, integration requirements,  and BB interaction diagram&#x20;
* Complies with Country enterprise architecture, including digital security protocols approved by the country technical team&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
How to get there:

* Develop the front end of the service according to the approved wireframes&#x20;
* Orchestrate the back end of the service according to the business blue print (BPMN), the BB integration map, configure connectors where need it &#x20;
* Prepare a test script considering compliance with technical specs as well as in the context of the entire "to-be" user journey. &#x20;
* Prepare the security and quality assurance check list &#x20;
* Prepare the digital service release plan &#x20;
* Prepare the stabilization and maintenance routine &#x20;
* Train citizens/business users, admins, and public officials interacting with the service on the functionalities of the service &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital team" %}
