# Understand user needs

Understanding who are we solving a problem for (Put terms in the glossary) is also important for creating a user-centric mindset within a digital service team  and build empathy and motivation for digital service design work. If there is a design lead on your team, they will likely lead this work, but the entire service team should be closely involved.&#x20;

Once we know who our service users are, we need to understand how they are currently “getting the job done” or how their needs are currently being met. Observational and structured research will help you hear what users say they like or dislike about their current state. Using a design thinking mindset to translate user feedback into underlying goals and problems will allow to identify problems and solutions the users may not have thought to articulate.&#x20;

In addition, no process, service, or product lives in a vacuum, so we want to understand how these fit together to impact the overall user experience along their  the way the entire journey. Past efforts and solutions will offer useful lessons to refine the understanding of what works and doesn’t work.&#x20;

Involvement from all partners participating along the journey is needed to complete their view of the current state of the service and/or what the users need.  Co-developing a shared baseline of where you are starting from is a necessary step to envisioning a path forward.&#x20;

A good understanding of the users…

* Defines the key users of the current process&#x20;
* Empathizes with their context of day-to-day activities, objectives, and goals&#x20;
* Describes the key steps and activities in their current process and identifies pain points&#x20;
* Demonstrates how users interact or depend on each other in order to achieve success&#x20;
* Organizes individual users into groups where appropriate&#x20;
* Distinguishes between those most affected or impacted by the current process and those with a more peripheral interest
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second Tab" %}
How to get there:



* Work with the service design lead (if you have one in the team) and your other team members to create a research plan. Determine what you want to learn, what methods you’ll use, and who will participate.&#x20;
* Map out the current user journey end-to-end, identifying the key actors involved, the activities they are doing, their goals, and the tools or systems they are using, as well as how this process fits into their day-to-day. You can use GovStack user journey template for this task and adjust it according to your research plan. &#x20;
* Map out critical decisions or steps that result in branches in the current process.&#x20;
* Identify explicit and implicit pain points and opportunities, including emotional pain points, functional blockers, and/or common drop-off rates or moments of failure.&#x20;
* Debrief after each session and adjust your research plan as needed.&#x20;
* Validate qualitative findings with quantitative data when possible, you can use RFI II – Service Catalogue & Systems to gather quantitative data across the different services involve in the user journey. &#x20;
* Ask the service owner if there have been any previous efforts in this area, and seek out any resulting reports, findings, or raw data.&#x20;
* Analyze and synthesize your findings with the service team, looking for patterns.&#x20;
* If the problem space is large, get alignment from business leads on initial prioritization to focus additional research activities.&#x20;
* Up-date glossary for roles, workflows, organizational entity – affiliation&#x20;

Who does what:

* Service designers – Lead the service co-design journey&#x20;
* User needs researchers – Prepare & apply user interviews, focus groups, facilitates user journey workshops &#x20;
* Legal advisors – Clarify regulations that apply to the service &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}
* Research plan &#x20;
* As-Is user journey &#x20;
* Findings & recommendations report (Should include qualitative & quantitative findings) &#x20;
* Who is who report &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Incorporation" %}
What to do next&#x20;

* Present the "as-is" user journey with qualitative & quantitative findings to organizational stakeholders to build empathy around the current state.&#x20;
* Translate your findings into preliminary recommendations or decision points around the problems and use cases to support.&#x20;
* Draw on your research to help your team articulate a concise problem statement, create an inspirational vision, and develop a strategy for achieving their desired [future state](https://product-guide.18f.gov/define/).&#x20;
