# Co-design with the users a memorable digital experience – the "to-be" user journey

Once you have presented the "as-is" user journey with qualitative & quantitative findings to the service community and relevant stakeholders. It is time to put into practice the preliminary recommendations in a series of co-designing sessions with service users and the service community to re-design all aspects of the service and co-create a new digital experience documented as a "to-be" user journey.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A good co-design process...

* Defines the key users of the ["to-be" journey](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-5-rfi-5).  These key users include citizens-business, public officials of the different entities that participate in the journey, and any stakeholder related to the service. &#x20;
* Describes the key steps and activities in their expected 'to-be' process &#x20;
* Identifies happy points (innovate in anticipating user needs)&#x20;
* Considers interoperability along the steps of the journey to reach the least viable number of touch points and a seamless experience. &#x20;
* Identifies access & delivery channels for the service – voice command, web, mobile app, sms, physical presence according to the service community context & needs &#x20;
* Identifies country legislation, policies & standards regulating the service &#x20;
* Identifies service components to be standardized (service information sheet, downloadable forms, web forms, electronic documents, notifications, performance analytics, citizen satisfaction survey, accessibility)&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
How to get there

* Map out critical decisions or steps that result in branches in the to-be user journey&#x20;
* Identify explicit and implicit happy points and opportunities to mitigate pain points, functional blockers, and/or common drop-off rates or moments of failure.&#x20;
* Debrief after each session and adjust your co-design plan as needed.&#x20;
* Validate qualitative findings with quantitative data when possible, you can use RFI II – Service Catalogue & Systems to gather quantitative data across the different services involve in the user journey. &#x20;
* Analyze and synthesize your findings with your team, looking for patterns.&#x20;
* List service components along the "to-be" user journey to be standardized (service information sheet, downloadable forms, web forms, electronic documents, notifications, performance analytics, citizen satisfaction survey, accessibility)&#x20;
* Up-date glossary for roles, workflows, organizational entity – affiliation   &#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}


* Co-design plan &#x20;
