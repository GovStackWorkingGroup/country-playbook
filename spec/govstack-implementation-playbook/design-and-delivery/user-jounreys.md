# User Jounreys

Understanding who are we solving a problem for is important for creating a user-centric mindset. User journeys (As-Is and To-Be) allow us to understand touchpoints, pain points, and opportunities for improvement associated with each action taken by the user to obtain the service.

<summary>Simplification principles </summary>

The co-design of the To-Be user journeys can be based on the following principles:

* Minimize redundancies by integrating and streamlining steps across the user journey. This can be achieved by: retrieving information required to obtain a service from registries; tailoring unified forms that are auto-filled and require only the data that does not already exist within registries.&#x20;
* Silence signifies tacitly expressed consent. Shifting the burden of proof in administrative proceedings. Example: Notifying the government of new business operations instead of requesting a business license.
* Elimination of requirements, data, or documents. Example: Validation of information through consulting the data from registries instead of requesting the user to present copies of documents.
* Reduction of the maximum term of resolution. Example: reduction in the time between application and approval for a business license.
* Extension of validity (to avoid the need for continuous renewals).
* Immediate resolution procedure. Access to registries should be completely automated, for example, obtaining birth certificates and attestation of no prosecution.

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
Service design Proposal:

* Service owners and stakeholders&#x20;
* As-Is and To-be user journeys, in which are mapped:
  * Actions are taken by the user to obtain a service
  * Legal justification
  * Touchpoints
  * Pain points
  * Opportunity for improvement
  * Current Building Blocks/DPGs
* Current and future stack
* Simplification opportunities
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
The following actions are recomended in gaining a thorough understanding of  user needs and mapping of a detailed user journey throughout various co-designing sessions (with users).&#x20;

* Ask the service owner if there have been any previous efforts in digitising the service, and seek out any resulting reports, findings, or raw data.&#x20;
* Map out the current user journey end-to-end, identifying the key actors involved, the activities they are doing, their goals, and the tools or systems they are using, as well as how this process fits into their daily life. You can use GovStack [user journey template](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5) for this task and adjust it according to your research plan. &#x20;

* Depending on the complexity of the service, you can request alignment from business leads on initial prioritization to focus additional research activities.
* Updating [glossary for roles](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy), workflows, and organizational entity responsible for each step within a user journey.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Responsibilities" %}
Who does what:

* Service designers/ Design lead – Creates a research plan (What are the research objectives, what methods to use, and participants) and guides the creation of user journeys.
* User needs researchers – Prepare & conduct user interviews, focus groups, facilitate user journey workshops &#x20;
* Legal advisors – Clarify regulations that apply to the service &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliverables" %}
* Research plan &#x20;
* As-Is user journey &#x20;
* [User/Business Life event Map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3)
* [Findings & recommendations report](../learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#findings-and-recommendations-report) (Should include qualitative & quantitative findings) .
* Who is who report &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Next steps" %}
What to do next:

* Present the "as-is" / "[Initial to-be](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5)" user journey with qualitative & quantitative findings to organizational stakeholders to build empathy around the current state.&#x20;
* Translate your findings into preliminary recommendations or decision points around the problems and use cases to support.&#x20;
* Draw on your research to help your team articulate a concise problem statement, create an inspirational vision, and develop a strategy for achieving their desired [future state](https://product-guide.18f.gov/define/).&#x20;

<summary>Terminology from this page</summary>

**Touchpoint**: A point of contact or interaction between a service and the user. Examples: physical visits to a government office, sending documents via post, phone call, sms, e-mail, voice command, and more.

**Pinpoint:** A persistent or recurring problem, as with a step within the service, that frequently inconveniences or annoys users. Example: filling multiple forms to access a service.

**Opportunity for improvement**: These are possible simplifications that can improve the user experience. Example:
