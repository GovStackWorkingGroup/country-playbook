# Prototype

## Develop, test, and iterate a functional prototype.

Once the wireframe and/or voice command flow is approved, we are ready to start developing and orchestrating a functional prototype of the service. Digital teams can either use GovStack sandbox or their own infrastructure. Since GovStack is currently in the process of developing the sandbox, future versions of the playbook will describe the processes to use GovStack sandbox to deply the functional prototype.&#x20;

In case the functional prototype is decided to be deployed on the country sandbox the functional prototype can be configured following GovStack enterprise architecture. Additionally, resources such as the Test script template, QA templates, and more (these resources will be added in the playbook as and when they are developed) will be useful when deploying the functional prototype on GovStack or country sandbox.

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A good functional prototype of the service …

* Complies with the approved 'To-be user journey' and wireframe and/or voice command flow
* Complies to Country digital service design standards. This includes standards for:&#x20;
  * [Service information sheet](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#information-service-sheets)
  * [Downloadable forms](broken-reference)
  * [Web forms](broken-reference)
  * [Electronic documents](broken-reference)
  * [Notifications](broken-reference)
  * [Performance analytics](broken-reference)
  * [Citizen satisfaction survey](broken-reference)
  * [Accessibility ](broken-reference)
* Complies with Country enterprise architecture, including digital security protocols approved by the country technical team&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities" %}
How to get there:

* Develop Product and Technical specifications for the service.
* Develop the front end and back end of the service according to the Product and Technical specifications and approved wireframes and/or voice command flow. &#x20;
* Develop a test script considering all the branches of "to-be" user journey. &#x20;
* Prepare the security and quality assurance checklist &#x20;
* Prepare the digital service release plan &#x20;
* Prepare the stabilization and maintenance routine &#x20;
* Launch the functional prototype to a limited set of citizens/business users, admins, and public officials.&#x20;
* Collect their feedback on the functional protoype and identify concreet steps to improve it.
* Go through a limited set of iterations to deliver a functional prototype that meets the requirements and needs of citizens/business users, admins, and public officials
