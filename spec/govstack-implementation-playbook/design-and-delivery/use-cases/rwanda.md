# Rwanda

## The problem

Improper disposal of e-waste poses numerous threats to the environment, economy, and health and well-being of citizens. Rwanda wanted to implement a legally transparent, digitally supported, and appropriately financed EPR digital service for the management of e-waste.

## GovStack approach

1. Completion of EPR regulatory framework for e-waste management in Rwanda
2. Co-design the EPR digital service based on user needs, journeys and business life events
3. Co-design the financial mechanism that producers must pay on Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) that is placed on the market in Rwanda to finance the sound management of e-waste.

## Roadmap

## Expected results

* A forward-looking e-waste regulation that will allow electronic producers to finance the collection, recycling and end-of-life disposal of e-waste equipment/product streams.&#x20;
* Facilitate compliance with e-waste regulation through EPR digital service.&#x20;
* Contribute to the digitization roadmap by scaling the GovStack Building Block approach used in EPR for the rest of the services in the digitization roadmap of Rwanda.
