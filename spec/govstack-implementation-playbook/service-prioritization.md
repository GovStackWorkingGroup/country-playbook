# Service prioritization

## Service prioritization & ranking

Defining which services should be digitized first varies from country to country. Prioritization criteria shall be based on data gathered through Request for Information Forms (RFI) [I](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-1-rfi-1), [II](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-2-rfi-2), [III](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-3-rfi-3), & [IV](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-4-rfi-4) in order to rank according to impact and feasibility. Services that are simple and done in a single iteration within one Ministry outreach are good candidates for quick wins, build a case to adopt a GovStack approach to digital service co-design standard and delivery protocol using reusable building blocks.

Once information has been gathered and validated with different service owners, strategic services should be accommodated in a matrix format to facilitate clustering and ranking. The criterion for prioritization will be based on information obtained from Request for Information Forms (RFI) through RFI, [I](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-1-rfi-1), [II](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-2-rfi-2), [III](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-3-rfi-3), & [IV](learning-and-exchange/artefacts.md#request-for-information-4-rfi-4) to rank services to work with according to the impact & feasibility of implementation.

Implementation will therefore be guided by the previous analysis, starting with services that are of the highest importance and highest feasibility, followed by those with high importance but low feasibility.

The criteria presented in this playbook can work as a reference to guide prioritization. However, each country can calibrate current criteria according to information availability, context, and needs.

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A comprehensive prioritization strategy...

* Defines prioritization criteria that apply to all government services in the government service catalog





* Set one or two exemplar services to work with implementing the GovStack approach to digital service co-design and delivery
* Identify building blocks/shared services/DPGs to be developed, or re-use from the Digital Public Goods Catalogue&#x20;
* Rank services according to the prioritization criteria defined
* Set a roadmap for the digitization of services&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activites" %}
* Define prioritization criteria.
* Map services to the user/business life events

* Gather data on the services by using the Service Catalog Template ([RFI-2](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#service-catalogue-request-for-information-rfi-2)). This allows analysis of prerequisites and identification of opportunities to simplify services before establishing a digitalization roadmap.

* Identify building blocks/shared services/DPGs to be developed, or re-use from the Digital Public Goods Catalogue &#x20;
* Set one or two exemplar services to work with implementing the GovStack approach to digital service co-design and delivery
* Compose a multi-disciplinary team to co-design and deliver the service
* Rank services according to the prioritization criteria defined

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Responsibilities" %}
Who does what:

* Head of Service Design - Lead the integration of the service catalog.
* Service Design and Delivery Focal point - Complement and update the service catalog with services from their organizations. They follow up and coordinate the actions within their organization to digitize services according to the approved digitization roadmap.
