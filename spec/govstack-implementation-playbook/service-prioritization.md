# Service prioritization

## Service prioritization & ranking

Defining which services should be digitized first varies from country to country. Prioritization criteria shall be based on the impact to citizens and businesses and the feasibility of digitizing based on the current technology stack.

The [criteria](service-prioritization.md#criteria) presented in this playbook can work as a reference to guide prioritization. However, each country can calibrate current criteria according to information availability, context, and needs.

* Abu Dhabi has developed a [catalog of services](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/) that maps services to user/business life events.&#x20;

#### Criteria

The criteria presented in this playbook are a reference. Each digital team can calibrate current criterion according to information availability, context & needs:

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A comprehensive prioritization strategy...

* Defines prioritization criteria that apply to all government services in the government service catalog
* Set one or two exemplar services to work with implementing the GovStack approach to digital service co-design and delivery
* Identify building blocks/shared services/DPGs to be developed, or re-use from the Digital Public Goods Catalog
* Rank services according to the prioritization criteria defined
* Set a roadmap for the digitization of services&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activites" %}
* Customize prioritization criteria according to country context and needs.
* Map services to the user/business life events: No process, service, or product lives in a vacuum, so we want to understand how these fit together to impact the overall user experience. This can be understood in detail through the use of [User/Business Life event map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3). Past efforts and solutions will offer useful lessons to refine the understanding of what works and doesnâ€™t work. In addition to mapping services to the user/business life events, you also create a catalog of services.

* Gather data on the services by using the Service Catalog Template ([RFI-2](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#service-catalogue-request-for-information-rfi-2)). This allows analysis of prerequisites and identification of opportunities to simplify services before establishing a digitalization roadmap.

* Identify building blocks/shared services/DPGs to be developed, or re-use from the Digital Public Goods Catalog &#x20;
* Set one or two exemplar services to work with implementing the GovStack approach to digital service co-design and delivery
* Compose a multi-disciplinary team to co-design and deliver the service
* Rank services according to the prioritization criteria defined

* Set a roadmap for the digitization of services&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Responsibilities" %}
Who does what:

* Head of Service Design - Lead the integration of the service catalog.
* Service Design and Delivery Focal point - Complement and update the service catalog with services from their organizations. They follow up and coordinate the actions within their organization to digitize services according to the approved digitization roadmap.
