# CMS, Somalia

## The problem

Currently, multiple government websites provide an inconsistent user experience when accessing information about government services. Somalia wanted a one-stop-shop for citizens to access all digital government services in one place allowing its users to navigate to service information sheets in a user-friendly, easy-to-understand, and consistent manner.

## GovStack approach

* Perform a digital readiness assessment
* Identify priority e-government services based on the country's context and needs.
* Co-design the digital service based on user needs, journeys, and business life events
* Identify a DPG/digital product that meets the business requirements of Somalia to integrate it with the national tech stack of Somalia
* Train the Djibouti digital team on [GovStack Building Block approach](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/2-description/building-block-approach).
