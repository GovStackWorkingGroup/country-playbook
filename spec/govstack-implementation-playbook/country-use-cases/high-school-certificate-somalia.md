# High School Certificate, Somalia

## The problem

At present a student in Somalia is required to travel to the office in the capital, Mogadishu. There they queue up and wait for their chance to: provide credentials, make payment to a Ministry of Finance employee within the same office(In cash or mobile money), collect the proof and present it to a receptionist, collect the physical copy of their result and finally have it attested with official stamps. This makes the process of collecting a high school certificate, time-consuming and complex. Somalia wanted a digital service that facilitates accessing high school certificates in a digital format.&#x20;

## GovStack approach

* Perform a digital readiness assessment
* Identify priority e-government services based on the country's context and needs.
* Co-design the digital service based on user needs, journeys, and business life events
* Organize a Deep Dive on the Building Blocks needed to enable the 'TO-BE' user journey
* Identify a DPG(s)/digital product(s) that meets the business requirements of Somalia to integrate it with the national tech stack of Somalia
* Train the Djibouti digital team on [GovStack Building Block approach](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/2-description/building-block-approach).
