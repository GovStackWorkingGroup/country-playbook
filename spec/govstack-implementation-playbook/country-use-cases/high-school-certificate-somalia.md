# High School Certificate, Somalia

## High School Certificate, Somalia

At present a student is required to travel to the office in the capital, Mogadishu. There the students are required to queue up and wait for their chance to: provide credentials, make payment to a Ministry of Finance employee within the same office(In cash or mobile money), collect the proof and present it to a receptionist, collect the physical copy of their result and finally have it attested with official stamps. This makes the process of collecting a high school certificate, non-inclusive, time-consuming, and tedious, and makes the individuals involved vulnerable to security threats.

A digital high school certificate service is an online platform that facilitates automated notification once the results are ready, online authentification of the student, and the issuance of high school certificates in an electronic format. Instead of receiving a traditional paper certificate, students can access their certificates digitally.

## GovStack approach

* Understanding context and regulations relevant to the High School Certificate&#x20;
* Co-design the High School Certificate based on user needs, journeys, and business life events and wireframes
* Identify a DPG compliant with the GovStack Building Block Specifications, that can be used to implement High School Certificate and integrated within the National Stack and can operate with other software components within it
* Identify and contract a system integrator responsible for implementing the High School Certificate and integrating it within the national stack.
