# Construction Permit, Djibouti

## About Construction Permit

Traditionally the application for construction permits, inspections, fee payments, and approval has been "over the counter" and paper-based. This makes construction permits time-consuming, complicated to understand, and difficult to comply with.

Digital Construction Permit streamlines the building plan approval system with configurable workflows for effective management through different phases of approval in a user-centric manner. The service provides the following functionalities:

* Online submission of building plans
* Online scrutiny of building plans
* Online fee calculation, payment & reporting
* Site visits scheduling & reporting mechanism
* Online application tracking (pending, rejected, approved)
* Configurable workflow and functionalities

## GovStack approach

* Co-design the Construction Permit service based on user needs, journeys, and business life events
* Identify a digital product that meets the business requirements of Djibouti to integrate it with the national stack of Djibouti.
* Identify the digital product through an [open call](https://www.leverist.de/en/app/opportunities/call-for-digital-products-to-manage-ecabinet-meetings-document-correspondence-and-policy-drafting-for-the-government-of-djibouti?force\_preview=1)[ ](https://www.leverist.de/en/app/opportunities/call-for-digital-products-to-manage-issuance-of-construction-permits-in-djibouti-using-the-govstack-building-block-approach?force\_preview=1)
* Identify a service provider responsible for integrating the selected digital product within the national stack of Djibouti.
