# e-Cabinet, Djibouti

## About e-Cabinet

Traditionally, cabinets have relied on physical documents, memos, and meetings to discuss and decide on various issues related to governance, policy-making, and administration. An e-cabinet system streamlines these processes by digitizing the entire workflow. Some key features of an e-cabinet system include:

1. Document Management: All cabinet-related documents, such as proposals, reports, and meeting agendas, are created, stored, and shared through the platform. This ensures real-time access and version control, minimizing the risk of miscommunication, information loss or duplication.
2. Collaboration and Communication: it enables seamless communication and collaboration among cabinet members, allowing them to share feedback, comments, and ideas on specific documents or proposals.
3. Decision Tracking: It maintains a record of all decisions made during cabinet meetings, along with the reasons behind them. This historical data can be valuable for reference in the future and for maintaining organizational memory.
4. Security and Access Control: it implements robust security measures to ensure that sensitive government information remains confidential and accessible only to authorized individuals.

## GovStack approach

* Identify a digital product that meets the business requirements of Djibouti to integrate it with the national stack of Djibouti.
* Identify the digital product through an [open call](https://www.leverist.de/en/app/opportunities/call-for-digital-products-to-manage-ecabinet-meetings-document-correspondence-and-policy-drafting-for-the-government-of-djibouti?force\_preview=1)&#x20;
* Identify a service provider responsible for integrating the selected digital product within the national stack of Djibouti.
