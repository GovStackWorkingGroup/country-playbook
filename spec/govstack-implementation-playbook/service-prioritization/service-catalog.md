# Service Catalog

Information about public services is often complicated to access and understand by citizens. Lack of homogeneity in terms of location, format, language, and level of detail results in a lack of understanding of actions and procedures users must undertake to obtain services.

The service catalog facilitates the display and presentation of services and their information in a user-centric way.

A good service catalog allows its user to easily:

* Find the service they need by identifying the event that triggered the search for service.
* Find the required information and actions to obtain the service.
* Understand the provided information and actions without any assistance.
* Obtain services in a uniform, simple, standardized way.
* Seek support from competent authority when needed.

* Set up a Content Management System (CMS) to create, populate, update, and maintain the service catalog.
* Develop a Service Information Sheet Standard (SISS). This sheet would contain standardized fields such as: service name; requirements; cost for the user; the location where the service can be obtained; concrete actions required from the user; and outcome of the service.&#x20;
* Designate a focal point in each Government entity to comprehensively capture the information of services corresponding to the agency according to SISS.
* Establish a ticketing system to allow the incorporation of citizens' feedback on the service information sheets.&#x20;
* Continuously train focal points on UX writing to ensure that service information sheets are easily understandable by their users.
*   Structure services within the service catalog according to business and life events, enabling end-users to find what they need by simply identifying the event that triggered the search for service. The following are a few examples of Service Catalogs:
