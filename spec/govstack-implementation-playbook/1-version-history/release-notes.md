# Release notes

## Version for TAC review - October 2022

The version for the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is an **early version** of the GovStack Implementation Playbook that contains major features under each section and has been released to TAC panel members, pilot countries' digital teams, and the organic public that reach the GovStack website, Govstack GitHub and GovStack community of practices for initial comments and feedback.&#x20;

This **early version** will allow the GovStack team **to test:**&#x20;

* Content structure and relevance
* Digital service co-design standard and delivery protocols
* Ease of use of the tools and methods included in each section
* Graphics and diagrams that explain key concepts&#x20;

As we move forward with the TAC review process and pilot reference implementations, the content will be updated constantly. Bare with us in this initial version and give us feedback! We are committed to active revision of comments and make every iteration of the playbook better.&#x20;
