# Service catalog

A government digital service catalog is an online platform or database that provides information about various digital services and resources offered by a government to its citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. The service catalog can be made available to users with a consistent/unified user experience.&#x20;

No service lives in a vacuum, thus it is important to understand how they fit together to impact the overall user experience. This interplay of services based on the life events that trigger their need can be mapped using the [User/Business Life event map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3). Once the services are mapped, they can be further analyzed to understand the level of their digital maturity and potential for simplification.

* Define the structure of the catalog of services. RFI-II provides a template to assist in [Cataloguing the services](../3-terminology.md#service-catalog). &#x20;

* Classify services based on their digital maturity. The level of maturity of services facilitates calculating the financial and technical effort that will be required to digitize/digitalize a citizen-centric government service. An example of classification is as follows:
  * Level 1- Informative: Information on the service is made available online yet the actual transaction happens in person.&#x20;
  * Level 2- Downloadable forms: The users can download and complete the forms while having to submit the same forms in-person or upload the documents.
  * Level 3- Submission of webform: Users can validate data showcased on the web form, upload the required documents, fill out forms, and submit them remotely.
  * Level 4: 100% online
* Understand how services are related to one another. [User/Business Life event map](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/guide-de-mise-en-oeuvre-de-govstack/apprentissage-et-echange/artefacts#user-business-life-events-request-for-information-rfi-3) can enable visual mapping of services to life events, their clustering, and identification of relations and dependencies.
* Abu Dhabi has developed a [catalog ](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/)that clusters services based on user/business life events.&#x20;
