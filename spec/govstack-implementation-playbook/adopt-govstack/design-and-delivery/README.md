# Design & Delivery

**This section provides an example approach to digitizing government services** based on [understanding user needs](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/digital-service-design-standard-and-delivery-protocol/understand-user-needs-and-identiry-as-is-user-journey), [life events](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-3-rfi-3), and [user journeys ](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/learning-and-exchange/artefacts#request-for-information-5-rfi-5)utilizing reusable software components/Building Blocks.&#x20;

The following image represents the design process using [UX/UI guidelines](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/v/govstack-specification-main/govstack-ui-ux-guidelines) to create a unified digital experience across all government services.

The above guidelines are usually captured in a transversal regulatory mandate defined as a "digital service design standard" or a "design system", which is applicable to all government services and easily implemented through the use of style guides, components, and patterns. GovStack provides [guidance ](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/v/govstack-specification-main/govstack-ui-ux-guidelines)to kick-start the design and development of UI/UX components layer for using the GovStack applications and building blocks.

GovStack has also developed [technical specifications](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/v/1.0/) for reusable software components/Building Blocks (BB) that enable the digitization of many government services across sectors, ministries, and departments.

GovStack provides a sandbox that allows its users to see the UX/UI guidelines and Building blocks in action.

A real-world example of service design and delivery roadmap is found in the framework put in place by the Government of Ukraine and presented below.
