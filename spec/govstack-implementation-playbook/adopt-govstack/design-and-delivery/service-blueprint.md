# Service blueprint

Service Blueprints are a continuum of “to-be” journeys which are a series of diagrams that visualize the relationship between different components such as user action/goals, Building Blocks, and Data Input/output.

A service blueprint is a diagram that visualizes the relationships between different service components - people, properties (physical or digital evidence), and processes - that are directly tied to touchpoints in a specific customer journey.

<summary>Benefits of service blueprint</summary>

* Identify weaknesses in the user interface: Blueprinting exposes the big picture and offers a map of dependencies, thus allowing a service designer to discover a weak leak at its roots.
* Identity opportunity for optimization: The visualization of relationships in blueprints uncovers potential improvements and ways to eliminate redundancy.&#x20;
* Coordinating complex services by bridging cross-dependent efforts. Blueprinting forces service designers to capture what occurs internally throughout the totality of the user journey, giving them insight into overlaps and dependencies that departments/ministries alone could not identify.

* Study the user journeys of the service
* Chart all the steps covered in the user journeys on the Service Blueprint template.
* For each step on the service blueprint:
  * Map the goals and actions performed by each service user, provider, and stakeholders
  * Data Input: Data required from the service users, providers, and stakeholders
  * Data output: Data presented to the service users, providers, and stakeholders at the completion of the step.
  * Identify and list the generic workflows that can facilitate the step
  * Based on the generic workflows and the GovStack technical specifications, list the potential set of Building Blocks that are required for the step.
* Upon completion of the service blueprint, map the generic design patterns to the steps on the blueprint.

Who does what:&#x20;

* [Service designer](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#service-designer) - Lead the co-design of the service blueprint
* [Product owners](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-workflow/v/development-6/) - Oversee the development of the service blueprint, provide input when required, and review the final blueprint.
* [User needs researchers](broken-reference) – provide the service users' perspective when developing the service blueprint.
* [Back-end developer](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy#back-end-developers) - assists in the identification and mapping of generic workflows and Building Blocks
* [UX/UI Designers](broken-reference) -assist in identifying the design patterns for each step in the service blueprint to later use in the development of wireframes.
