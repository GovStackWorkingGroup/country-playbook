# Reference architecture

Reference architecture is the blueprint used to put the pieces of the organizational & systems puzzle together. Digital teams use reference architecture to promote the reuse of common assets and identify capability gaps. It:&#x20;

* Defines a common language for consistent communication within the organization&#x20;
* Outlines all capabilities needed to achieve the best outcome&#x20;
* Provides the ability of systems or software to exchange and make use of information &#x20;
* Establishes standard systems, and a common way to exchange information

* Develop the systems/software/platform catalog to identify reusable software components/Building Blocks that can support the digitization of services.
* Identify additional Building Blocks/ reusable software components that are critical in building a national stack that can facilitate the development of prioritized citizen-centric digital services.&#x20;
* Define the approach to adding new/updated Building Blocks within the national stack, either through tendering, developing indigenously, or re-using existing Building Blocks. [GovExchange ](https://exchange.dial.global/)provides a catalog of digital public goods that can be used as a reference.

**Examples of Reference Architectures:**

* In Australia, their [reference architecture document](https://www.architecture.dta.gov.au/sp\_aga2?id=aga2\_how\_to\_use) provides digital teams the guidance they need to align current and emerging tech into a sound orchestration of solutions to enable digital government service design and delivery
