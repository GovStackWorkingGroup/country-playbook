# Service prioritization

## Service prioritization & ranking

Defining which services should be digitized first varies from country to country. Prioritization criteria are usually based on selecting high-impact use cases for citizens and businesses and the feasibility of digitalizing them using current and future reusable software components/building blocks - the Country´s technology stack.&#x20;

The experience gained from deploying and integrating different software components/building blocks and designing the underlying systems needed to enable the priority use cases allows digital teams to gain the necessary experience to work with a building block approach. As more services are developed with reusable software components/BBs, the faster each design and delivery cycle becomes reaching scalability in a more sustainable and cost-efficient manner.

More information on how to deploy and integrate building blocks to enable digital government services is available in the [GovStack Sandbox documentation](https://govstack.gitbook.io/sandbox/).

{% tab title="Activites / resources" %}
* Rank the catalog of services based on your country´s criteria for impact and feasibility.&#x20;
* Set one or two exemplar services from quadrant A to work with implementing the GovStack approach to [digital service co-design and delivery](design-and-delivery/)

* The below criteria are a reference. Each digital team can calibrate current criterion according to information availability, context & needs:

* Continuously recalibrate the ranking based on:
  * Learnings of the different design and delivery cycles and as re-usability of BBs become common practice across digital teams.&#x20;
  * Simplification measures applied to the service catalog. For example, eliminating services associated with getting documents that another government entity requires by automatic consultations to different registries in government entities using [IM BB](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-information-mediation/v/information-mediation-1.0).&#x20;
  * Re-designing user journeys based on live events and proactively delivering them using event-driven architectures. Refer below examples from Estonia's vision documents on proactive services and event-driven architecture:

Who does what:

* Head of Service Design - Lead the integration of the service catalog.
* Service Design and Delivery Focal point - Complement and update the service catalog with services from their organizations. They follow up and coordinate the actions within their organization to digitize services according to the approved digitization roadmap
