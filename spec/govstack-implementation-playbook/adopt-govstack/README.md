# Adopt GovStack

The GovStack implementation framework considers incorporating a BB approach at the level of digital institutional governance, ICT policy & citizen-centric co-design & delivery of government digital services.&#x20;

GovStack gathers best practices from leading digital teams across the world. Below is a suggested journey that covers the most important aspects of digitizing government services at scale:

1. It starts with understanding the country's context and needs
2. Identifying  current tech stack
3. Cataloging services based on life events
4. Identifying priority services to digitize according to feasibility and impact (demand)
5. Design and delivery of citizen-centric digital services using reusable software components
6. Development of a scaling strategy that leverages the reusable technology stack

The aim of the GovStack is to facilitate digital teams around the world to build their own digital service design standard and government technology stack organically. Starting with one or two priority services that use a small set of reusable software components (BBs).&#x20;

The digitization of priority services will allow digital teams to gain valuable hands-on experience in:&#x20;

* Applying UX/UI guidelines, deploying containerized Building Block applications, API integration, regulatory compliance on data protection, integration testing, and more.&#x20;
* Designing of citizen-centric digital services
* Re-using software components/building blocks integrated into the national stack across all government services
* Tailoring of scaling strategy that leverages the national stack to digitize services rapidly, efficiently, and in a standardized fashion.
