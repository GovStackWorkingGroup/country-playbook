# Learning and Exchange

This section builds on insights for capacity development and knowledge-sharing, which are essential for the success of digital transformation. Digital government is rooted in a vision that strongly believes in continuous learning for the ultimate beneficiaries of its initiatives: governments and their citizens.

The purpose of learning and exchange activities is to promote a systematic process of Capacity Building that utilizes effective methodologies and fosters cross-cultural knowledge sharing within and across professional and academic institutions. All these best practices are captured within the GovStack Learning and Management System that will enable countries to build sustainable capacities.
