# Digital skills in relation to capacity building

### Why digital skills are needed? &#x20;

Today, the need for skill enhancements, due to the continuously changing technology landscape, is very different from what it was few years ago. Having digital skills helps us to lead a complete life at work as well as in communication with family and friends. For example, the “new normal” as a consequence of the pandemic has highlighted the challenges that still exist when it comes to connecting households and people, and the digital skills required to participate effectively in the online world. The need for a digitally competent population and the demand for a digitally skilled workforce have grown even more pronounced today.&#x20;

#### What are Digital Skills?&#x20;

Digital skills include a “combination of behaviors, expertise, know-how, work habits, character traits, dispositions and critical understandings”. Thus, digital skills could be further divided into multiple different skills as follows: &#x20;

* _**Technical skills**_: the ability to use a smart mobile device, an application, and to navigate online to accomplish a task &#x20;
* _**Professional technical skills**_: the ability to understand various techniques involved in conceptualizing, designing, development, testing, integration, operations & maintenance of a software products. These broadly include Software Development Life cycle (SDLC), Project management (Agile), Open Source, Open Data, digital infrastructure including cloud, architecture and so on.&#x20;
* _**Information management skills**_: the ability to access and use information to make informed decisions &#x20;
* _**Online communication skills**_: the ability to communicate with stakeholders online with clarity. Communication is crucial when working in the digitized platform market because stakeholders often have never met. &#x20;
* _**Critical thinking and problem-solving skills:**_ the ability to use ICT to make informed judgments and choices, and then use the information gathered to solve a problem &#x20;
* _**Enterprise Skills**_: Communication, Collaboration, Project management, Continuous learning, Product management lifecycle, Problem solving, Digital leadership, Design thinking etc.&#x20;
* _**Other skills supplementary**_ to digital skills: the ability to apply skills in practice, proficiency in the English or the working language, presentation skills, mind-set and behavior in terms of self-motivation to learn, interest in lifelong learning, and a “go the extra mile” mentality.

{% tab title="Technical Skills to support GovStack Approach" %}
GovStack is a unique approach that emphasizes the Building Block Approach over existing monolithic approach. This approach calls for few more additional skills to what has been described as part of digital skills.

The following are suggested **technical focus areas** that are recommended for implementation of GovStack Approach. These skills may be acquired by various stakeholders as relevant to them.&#x20;

{% tab title="Non-technical skills" %}
&#x20; Suggested **non-technical focus** areas include:

* Understanding the difference between digitization, digitalization and digital transformation&#x20;
* Awareness at all levels&#x20;
* Communication/Publicity strategy&#x20;
* Ethics&#x20;
* Citizen engagement
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GovStack approach of digitilization" %}
#### How digital skills helps countries to implement the GovStack approach

The proposed behaviour, knowledge, skills will come in hand at various stages of lifecycle activities of stakeholders. For example, a citizen can know about GovStack through citizen engagement and demand for non-listed services. Similarly, a department/ministry understands what are the key competencies required to conceptualize, design/co-design, plan, implement various activities while adopting GovStack approach.

### Training Delivery to support digital services

GovStack approach provides different training topics in accordance with user profiles which support to better implement the GovStack approach. In order to establish right approach and move towards digital services first the general knowledge according the GovStack eco system as well digital governance era with respect to digital transformation is needed. GovStack has developed main training topics to each stakeholder who will be involved with the GovStack implantation journey and is involved or assist digital teams. However, many [open-source courses](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/Training%20%26%20Capacity%20Building/List\_Training\_Courses\_OS.docx?d=w294c784885ee404588eae8ecf5ad7201\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=2ucft2) are available which can support our approach during the implementation stages.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Tenets of Training Programs" %}
The main tenets of such training programs are - &#x20;

1\. Easily understandable training content&#x20;

2\. Regular, frequent, dedicated support&#x20;

3\. Channels of training support&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="What kind of training content is needed" %}
For best outcomes, it is advised that we kick of the training plan with a strategic discussion with all the key stakeholders involved in the overall digital transformation of services program. Typically start by creating a common understanding of the benefits digitization of services can create for both the government and the beneficiary. Such a practice allows root everyone's focus on a user centric view of service transformation. This can then be followed up by deeper technical training sessions. The best outcomes are achieved when trainings are imparted frequently and regularly, and feedback is sought from trainees about what could be done better to improve the training experience. &#x20;

For example, in e-Chhawani program in India, trainings were delivered once every quarter. A special emphasis was laid on ensuring easy access to training materials with repeated reminders of how to access them. In addition, a specific time every quarter was dedicated to trainings and these trainings were calendarized for the entire year. E.g. - 2nd week of each quarter.&#x20;
