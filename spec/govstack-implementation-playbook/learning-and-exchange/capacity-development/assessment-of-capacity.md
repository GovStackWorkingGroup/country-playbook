# Assessment of capacity

### Assessing the Level of Knowledge

Digital skills are essential, therefore, there is a need to understand the existing eco-system and to conduct a meaningful training skills assessment and analysis in line with identified GovStack practices.&#x20;

If you want to objectively measure knowledge, as a general rule, you begin with a validated measure of maybe ten questions (e.g., something from a final exam on service design). It is suggested to take a look at the 3 lower levels of [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/instructional-strategies/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/) that measure knowledge, comprehension and application.&#x20;

{% tab title="Stage One" %}
Before embarking on the **capacity/skills assessments journey,** there are two important aspects to take into consideration: &#x20;

1\. Which stage of digital transformation the country in question is at.&#x20;

2\. Which group of people will have their ‘digital’ skills assessed and what are their respective roles in the digital transformation journey.&#x20;


{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital Assessment" %}
As part of the preparations for the **country implementation journey**, it is essential for GovStack, to define the steps below:&#x20;

* The targeted group to be assessed&#x20;
* The assessment methodology&#x20;
* The evaluation process/ criteria&#x20;
* The different stages of the implementation journey and the respective skills needed at each stage.&#x20;



When **evaluating a country's level of knowledge and readiness**, the following key roles have been identified, and have to be evaluated:&#x20;

**Technical teams:** &#x20;

* Agile S/W development approaches&#x20;
* Cloud hosting&#x20;
* Security&#x20;
* Technical support (Help desks and Call centers)&#x20;
* Open-Source usage&#x20;

**Administrative functions:**&#x20;

* Service definition and cataloguing&#x20;
* Developing MOU’s for inter agencies cooperation &#x20;
* Change management &#x20;
* Process simplification &#x20;
* Legislations changing to accommodate digital services&#x20;

**Policy and decision makers:**&#x20;

* Strategies setting&#x20;
* Monitoring and evaluation&#x20;
* Roadmaps for services implementations&#x20;
* Prioritization &#x20;

**Interoperability**&#x20;

**Shared services**&#x20;

{% tab title="RFI 4" %}
As one of the Capacity Building assessment tools, GovStack uses [RFI 4](https://form.jotform.com/222551422978056) in order to nail our approach.&#x20;

&#x20;**Goals/Objectives for** [**RFI 4**](https://form.jotform.com/222551422978056)****

* Define the recipients and their skills development needs&#x20;
* Design the appropriate content based on the existing level of knowledge&#x20;

Besides [RFI 4](https://form.jotform.com/222551422978056) GovStack has developed a [questionnaire](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/Country%20Engagement/Country%20Engagement%20Playbook/Templates/GovStackCBStrategy-Template-V1-08Aug22-Vikash%20\(1\).docx?d=wf24fec7d065d4b23a770f1cbc42e6f67\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=OLZKqn) which assesses decision making, organization and technical capacity from different perspectives.&#x20;

Finally, it is important to develop a report showing the needs and the skills to be addressed in the country engagement journey

{% tab title="GovStack Skill Matrix" %}
#### Inventory of the Capacity of staff and technology&#x20;

Inventory of the staff and technology is also an important part of the GovStack's capacity building activities. As a starting point, we have identified various ecosystems and assessment frameworks to help us build a skill matrix.&#x20;



**What is the GovStack Skill Matrix** &#x20;

* The skill matrix shows the ‘digital’ skill in question along with its level of mastering versus the stakeholder.&#x20;
* The matrix will be used to determine the need to capacity building and the topic to be addressed as well as the recipient group&#x20;
* The matrix should be maintained regularly to show the progress of capacity building and the need for new capacity building activities
