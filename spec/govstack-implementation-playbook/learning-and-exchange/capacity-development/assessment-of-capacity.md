# Assessment of capacity

### Assessing the Level of Knowledge

Digital skills are essential, therefore, there is a need to understand the existing eco-system and to conduct a meaningful training skills assessment and analysis in line with identified GovStack practices.&#x20;

The three lower levels of [Bloom's Taxonomy (Iowa State University n.d.)](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/instructional-strategies/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/) provide a clear understanding of the assessment criteria for knowledge, comprehension, and application.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Stage One" %}
Before embarking on the **capacity/skills assessments journey,** there are two important aspects to take into consideration: &#x20;

1\. Which stage of digital transformation the country in question is at.&#x20;

2\. Which group of people will have their ‘digital’ skills assessed and what are their respective roles in the digital transformation journey.&#x20;


{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Digital Assessment" %}
As part of the preparations for the **country implementation journey**, it is essential for GovStack, to define the steps below:&#x20;

* The targeted group to be assessed&#x20;
* The assessment methodology&#x20;
* The evaluation process/ criteria&#x20;
* The different stages of the implementation journey and the respective skills needed at each stage.&#x20;



When **evaluating a country's level of knowledge and readiness**, the following key roles have been identified, and have to be evaluated:&#x20;

**Technical teams:** &#x20;

* Agile S/W development approaches&#x20;
* Cloud hosting&#x20;
* Security&#x20;
* Technical support (Help desks and Call centers)&#x20;
* Open-Source usage&#x20;

**Administrative functions:**&#x20;

* Service definition and cataloguing&#x20;
* Developing MOU’s for inter agencies cooperation &#x20;
* Change management &#x20;
* Process simplification &#x20;
* Legislations changing to accommodate digital services&#x20;

**Policy and decision makers:**&#x20;

* Strategies setting&#x20;
* Monitoring and evaluation&#x20;
* Roadmaps for services implementations&#x20;
* Prioritization &#x20;

**Interoperability**&#x20;

**Shared services**&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Current digital capability in country (RFI-4)" %}
As one of the Capacity Building assessment tools, GovStack uses [RFI 4](https://form.jotform.com/222551422978056) in order to nail our approach.&#x20;

&#x20;**Goals/Objectives for** [**RFI 4**](https://form.jotform.com/222551422978056)****

* Define the recipients and their skills development needs&#x20;
* Design the appropriate content based on the existing level of knowledge&#x20;

Finally, it is important to develop a report showing the needs and the skills to be addressed in the country engagement journey
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GovStack Skill Matrix" %}
#### Inventory of the Capacity of staff and technology&#x20;

Inventory of the staff and technology is also an important part of GovStack's capacity building activities. As a starting point, we have identified various ecosystems and assessment frameworks to help us build a skill matrix.&#x20;



**What is the GovStack Skill Matrix** &#x20;

The skill matrix shows the digital skill in question along with its level of proficiency for each stakeholder and is used to determine capacity-building needs, the topics that should be addressed, and the target group.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Capability and capacity needs assessment&#x20;

Before embarking on the implementation journey, it is important to assess the capability and capacity needs of the identified GovStack profiles. This will enable the stakeholders to be matched with the requisite trainings and skills to enable implementation of GovStack's digitalization and Building Block approach.&#x20;

The table below provides a comprehensive overview of the training resources for various stakeholders, the necessary skill sets, and necessary trainings that have been developed by various organizations.
