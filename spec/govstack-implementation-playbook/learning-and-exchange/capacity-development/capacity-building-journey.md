# Capacity building journey

## Why digital skills are needed? &#x20;

Today, the need for skill enhancements, due to the continuously changing technology landscape, is very different from what it was few years ago. Having digital skills helps us to lead a complete life at work as well as in communication with family and friends. For example, the “new normal” as a consequence of the pandemic has highlighted the challenges that still exist when it comes to connecting households and people, and the digital skills required to participate effectively in the online world. The need for a digitally competent population and the demand for a digitally skilled workforce have grown even more pronounced today. &#x20;

#### What are Digital Skills?&#x20;

&#x20;Digital skills include a “combination of behaviours, expertise, know-how, work habits, character traits, dispositions and critical understandings”. Thus, digital skills could be further divided into multiple different skills as follows: &#x20;

* Technical skills: the ability to use a smart mobile device, an application, and to navigate online to accomplish a task &#x20;
* Professional technical skills: the ability to understand various techniques involved in conceptualizing, designing, development, testing, integration, operations & maintenance of a software products. These broadly include Software Development Life cycle (SDLC), Project management (Agile), Open Source, Open Data, digital infrastructure including cloud, architecture and so on.&#x20;
* Information management skills: the ability to access and use information to make informed decisions &#x20;
* Online communication skills: the ability to communicate with stakeholders online with clarity. Communication is crucial when working in the digitized platform market because stakeholders often have never met. &#x20;
* Critical thinking and problem-solving skills: the ability to use ICT to make informed judgments and choices, and then use the information gathered to solve a problem &#x20;
* Enterprise Skills: Communication, Collaboration, Project management, Continuous learning, Product management lifecycle, Problem solving, Digital leadership, Design thinking etc.&#x20;
* Other skills supplementary to digital skills: the ability to apply skills in practice, proficiency in the English language, presentation skills, mind-set and behavior in terms of self-motivation to learn, interest in lifelong learning, and a “go the extra mile” mentality.&#x20;

#### What Digital Skills are required for GovStack Approach&#x20;

As we have seen in earlier sections, GovStack is a unique approach that emphasizes the Building Block Approach over existing monolithic approach. This approach calls for few more additional skills to what have been discussed in the above section.&#x20;

The following are suggested technical focus areas that are recommended for implementation of GovStack Approach. These skills may be acquired by various stakeholders as relevant to them.&#x20;

* Understanding the difference between digitization, digitalization and digital transformation&#x20;
* Software Reusable components&#x20;
* Building Blocks / Lego bricks game&#x20;
* Open Source Solutions&#x20;
* Workflows&#x20;
* Interoperability&#x20;
* Service Standards&#x20;
* Sandbox environment&#x20;
* Testing&#x20;
* Agile Project Management&#x20;
* User stories&#x20;
* User experience&#x20;
* Design thinking&#x20;
* User journey&#x20;
* Digital infrastructure like Cloud etc.&#x20;
* Security&#x20;
* Privacy&#x20;
* Enterprise Architecture&#x20;

&#x20;Suggested non-technical focus areas&#x20;

* &#x20;Awareness at all levels&#x20;
* Communication/Publicity strategy&#x20;
* Ethics&#x20;
* Citizen engagement &#x20;

#### How it helps countries to implement the GovStack approach &#x20;

The proposed behaviour, knowledge, skills will come in hand at various stages of lifecycle activities of stakeholders. For example, a citizen can know about GovStack through citizen engagement and demand for non-listed services. Similarly, a department/ministry understands what are the key competencies required to conceptualize, design/co-design, plan, implement various activities while adopting GovStack approach.&#x20;

&#x20;

### Stakeholders Who Support Capacity Building

#### Stakeholder Responsibility and Roles

There can be different kind of stakeholders (government and internal) and external stakeholders who support capacity building during the digital transformation process. Within GovStack, we have identified various internal stakeholder profiles that will support the ten stages of the implementation journey. The profiles are as follows:&#x20;

&#x20;**Program Sponsor/Top management/policy makers**&#x20;

Their main function is as decision-makers in national or regional governments, and head government entities. They perform legislative duties and are in charge of the long-term planning for the government ministries. Management can be top and middle. The top management job positions are:&#x20;

* Chief Technology Officer (CTO)&#x20;
* Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)&#x20;
* Elected Reps&#x20;
* Ministries of Digital Transformation&#x20;
* Bureaucrats&#x20;
* Digital Transformation Agencies&#x20;

&#x20;On the other hand, policy officials research, analyse and develop policies in various public sectors, and shape and implement these policies to improve the existing regulation around the sector. They evaluate effects of existing policies and report findings to the government and members of the public. Policy officers work closely with partners, external organisations or other stakeholders and provide them with regular updates. Main job positions are:&#x20;

* Fundraisers&#x20;
* Civil Society&#x20;

**Program Implementers**&#x20;

IT specialist Middle managers plan, organize, direct, control and coordinate various departments within the government such as administrative, digital transformation, human resource, public relations, accounting and finance etc. They take directives from the top managers, implement the strategies and supervise the operations of their entities at the national and regional levels. They also coordinate between the top and lower levels of management to ensure the set targets are met. They advise  on ICT system integration  on bringing together different systems to interoperate within an organization for enabling data sharing and reducing redundancy. They  contribute to the development of the organization's strategic plan and ensure that the ICT infrastructure supports the organization's overall operations and priorities. Plan, direct, or coordinate activities in such fields as electronic data processing, information systems, systems analysis, and computer programming. Main job positions are:&#x20;

  &#x20;

**Trainers** - Design or conduct work-related training and development programs to improve individual skills or organizational performance. They may analyze organizational training needs or evaluate training effectiveness. They also perform research in the area of education, strive to broaden the knowledge on how education processes, educational systems, and individuals (teachers and learners) work. They foresee areas of improvement and develop plans for the implementation of innovations. Finally, they advise legislators and policy makers on educational issues and assist in the planning of educational policies. Some of the job positions are:&#x20;

* Training content creators&#x20;
* Professional Trainers or Training organizations&#x20;
* Change Management Officers&#x20;
* Educational Researchers&#x20;
* University Research Assistants&#x20;

&#x20;

**End Users –** These are the actual users of applications. These are people who either a) deliver services directly or indirectly to the end beneficiaries or b) are recipients of the services. Includes employees, citizens, etc.&#x20;

### Training Delivery to support digital services

GovStack approach provides different training topics in accordance to user profiles which support to better implement the GovStack approach. In order to establish right approach and move towards digital services first the general knowledge according the GovStack eco system as well digital governance era with respect to digital transformation is needed. GovStack has developed main training topics to each stakeholder who will be involved with the GovStack implantation journey and is involved or assist digital teams. However, many [open source courses](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/Training%20%26%20Capacity%20Building/List\_Training\_Courses\_OS.docx?d=w294c784885ee404588eae8ecf5ad7201\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=2ucft2) are available which can support the our approach during the implementation stages.&#x20;

#### What kind of training content is needed&#x20;

For best outcomes, it is advised that we kick of the training plan with a strategic discussion with all the key stakeholders involved in the overall digital transformation of services program. Typically start by creating a common understanding of the benefits digitization of services can create for both the government and the beneficiary. Such a practice allows root everyone's focus on a user centric view of service transformation. This can then be followed up by deeper technical training sessions. The best outcomes are achieved when trainings are imparted frequently and regularly and feedback is sought from trainees about what could be done better to improve the training experience. &#x20;

For example, in e-Chhawani program in India, trainings were delivered once every quarter. A special emphasis was laid on ensuring easy access to training materials with repeated reminders of how to access them. In addition, a specific time every quarter was dedicated to trainings and these trainings were calendarized for the entire year. E.g. - 2nd week of each quarter. The main tenets of such training programs are - &#x20;

1\. Easily understandable training content&#x20;

2\. Regular, frequent, dedicated support&#x20;

3\. Channels of training support&#x20;

The main user profiles are as follows based on which the general course topics has been proposed to support capacity building within GovStack approach:&#x20;

### Development and Customization of Capacity Building

GovStack focuses a lot on process and people within the implementation journey. We have defined capacity building as a process in which individuals, organizations and societies, develop, strengthen and maintain the skills to implement GovStack’s BB. Capacity development is not a single intervention but an iterative process of design-application-learning-adjustment.&#x20;

&#x20;**Relevant adult learning concepts:**&#x20;

For many years, research and practice has recognized differences between how children and adults learn. Thus, this section highlight high-level adult learning theory along with recommendations to enhance practice for the effective implementation of GovStack's BB. &#x20;

* **Adults need to know the reason for learning something,** translating into practice, when adapting content is important that trainers clearly describe the learning objectives and provide spaces to understand participant's motivations (e.g., collecting participant's information during pre-planning stage, facilitating the "participant's expectations" at the beginning of capacity building sessions and make connections throughout the sessions). &#x20;
* **Adult life experiences are a rich resource for learning (or barrier),** over the years, adults have accumulated knowledge and experience that can be leverage as a resource for learning. In fact, cognitive science has shown that adults tend to refer back to past knowledge first. This experiences can be sourced through pairing exercises, group discussion, and problem solving exercises. &#x20;
* As people mature there is a change in time perspective – from future application of knowledge to immediacy. In other words, adults want to learn a skill or acquire knowledge that they can apply pragmatically to their immediate circumstances. Life or work-related situations present a more appropriate framework for adult learning than academic or theoretical approaches. &#x20;
* Learning styles are influenced by personality type, educational specialization, career choice, and current job role and task. Designing capacity building programs that engage different learning styles and adapt to different contexts are more effective.&#x20;

#### Development and Customization Model&#x20;

&#x20;The model employs design-thinking and human-centric design methodologies for learning and performance. Thus, instead of focusing on learning a topic or combination of topics, it focuses on solving problems and achieving stated organizational goals. Thus, the organization of this chapter.

### Capacity Building Journey&#x20;

The main activities within GovStack approach are as follows:&#x20;

* Define profiles, [roles](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B814A41FB-59BA-4851-99E6-D164CCCA77DE%7D\&file=Team%20profile%20skills%2C%20roles%20and%20responsibilities.docx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true), and qualifications in order to understand the existing roles of the country. Prioritize profiles based on its criticality.&#x20;
* Conduct capacity building needs assessment and SWOT analysis   &#x20;
* Identify gaps and try to understand what type of skills are needed, using [RFI 4](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7) as a guide.&#x20;
* Review capacity-building inventory and identify gaps in capacity-building assets &#x20;
* Complete curriculum map and validate with users in order to understand what type of skills are needed.&#x20;
* Align capacity-building intervention with the HOAI's program lifecycle    &#x20;
* Design learning journeys per one user persona and refine [Excel spreadsheet](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3376623E-C009-4D74-81AB-75C54849E6CE%7D\&file=Capacity%20Building%20Framework.xlsx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true) &#x20;
* The design team and organizational interventions &#x20;
* Complete and cost capacity building program and MEL &#x20;
* Consolidate capacity building activities   &#x20;
* Pilot, test, and refine training per user persona &#x20;
* Implement, assess, and improve interventions&#x20;

The process of these activities and main tools used can be found here [Capacity Building Framework Journey](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfe\_-C4=/).&#x20;

Additionally, GovStack has created a supportive environment for capacity building by creating various training materials collected in GovStack LMS. It consists of different modules which are aimed towards supporting capacity building phases during the whole [GovStack implementation Journey](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7)&#x20;
