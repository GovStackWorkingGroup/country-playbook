# Capacity building journey

### Capacity Building Journey&#x20;

The main activities within GovStack approach are as follows:&#x20;

* Define profiles, [roles](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B814A41FB-59BA-4851-99E6-D164CCCA77DE%7D\&file=Team%20profile%20skills%2C%20roles%20and%20responsibilities.docx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true), and qualifications in order to understand the existing roles of the country. Prioritize profiles based on its criticality.&#x20;
* Conduct capacity building needs assessment and SWOT analysis   &#x20;
* Identify gaps and try to understand what type of skills are needed, using [RFI 4](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7) as a guide.&#x20;
* Review capacity-building inventory and identify gaps in capacity-building assets &#x20;
* Complete curriculum map and validate with users in order to understand what type of skills are needed.&#x20;
* Align capacity-building intervention with the HOAI's program lifecycle    &#x20;
* Design learning journeys per one user persona and refine [Excel spreadsheet](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3376623E-C009-4D74-81AB-75C54849E6CE%7D\&file=Capacity%20Building%20Framework.xlsx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true) &#x20;
* The design team and organizational interventions &#x20;
* Complete and cost capacity building program and MEL &#x20;
* Consolidate capacity building activities   &#x20;
* Pilot, test, and refine training per user persona &#x20;
* Implement, assess, and improve interventions&#x20;

The process of these activities and main tools used can be found here [Capacity Building Framework Journey](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfe\_-C4=/).&#x20;

Additionally, GovStack has created a supportive environment for capacity building by creating various training materials collected in GovStack LMS. It consists of different modules which are aimed towards supporting capacity building phases during the whole [GovStack implementation Journey](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7)&#x20;
