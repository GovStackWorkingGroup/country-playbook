# Capacity building Journey

### Capacity Building Journey&#x20;

Capacity-building is defined as the process of developing and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, processes and resources that organizations and communities need to survive, adapt, and thrive in a fast-changing world. Through capacity building, organizations share knowledge, expertise and good practices to react better and faster to emergencies. GovStack approach is very iterative and co-creation based. The main activities within GovStack GovStack Capacity Building approach is described as follows:&#x20;

<summary>12 steps of the Capacity Framework Journey</summary>

1. Define profiles, [roles](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B814A41FB-59BA-4851-99E6-D164CCCA77DE%7D\&file=Team%20profile%20skills%2C%20roles%20and%20responsibilities.docx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true), and qualifications in order to understand the existing roles of the country. Prioritize profiles based on its criticality.&#x20;
2. Conduct capacity building needs assessment and SWOT analysis&#x20;
3. Identify gaps and try to understand what type of skills are needed, using [RFI 4](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7) as a guide.   &#x20;
4. Review capacity-building inventory and identify gaps in capacity-building assets.
5. Complete curriculum map and validate with users in order to understand what type of skills are needed.&#x20;
6. Align capacity-building intervention with the HOAI's program lifecycle.
7. Design learning journeys per one user persona and refine [Excel spreadsheet](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3376623E-C009-4D74-81AB-75C54849E6CE%7D\&file=Capacity%20Building%20Framework.xlsx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true).
8. The design team and organizational interventions.
9. Complete and cost capacity building program and MEL.
10. Consolidate capacity building activities.
11. Pilot, test, and refine training per user persona.
12. Implement, assess, and improve interventions&#x20;

The process of these activities and main tools used can be found here [Capacity Building Framework Journey](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfe\_-C4=/). The framework encompasses the whole [Country Implementation Journey](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7), and timeline for all the Capacity Building activities.

Additionally, GovStack has created a supportive environment for capacity building by creating various training materials collected in [GovStack LMS](../govstack-learning-management-system/). It consists of different modules which are aimed towards supporting capacity building phases during the whole [GovStack implementation Journey](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7).

### Development and Customization of Capacity Building

GovStack focuses a lot on process and people within the implementation journey. We have defined capacity building as a process in which individuals, organizations and societies, develop, strengthen and maintain the skills to implement GovStack’s BB. Capacity development is not a single intervention but an iterative process of design-application-learning-adjustment.&#x20;

#### Development and Customization Model&#x20;

The model employs design-thinking and human-centric design methodologies for learning and performance. Thus, instead of focusing on learning a topic or combination of topics, it focuses on solving problems and achieving stated organizational goals.&#x20;

It involves 3 phases as described below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Phase 1   " %}
### **Phase 1 – Pre-planning:**

1. &#x20;What is the concept you are exploring? Develop a capacity building framework that complements launching digital government services (GovStack/BB) as well helps to build digital competency/readiness among Government agencies.&#x20;
2. What is the challenge or opportunity this concept addresses?&#x20;
3.  Which groups need to be involved in addressing the concept? (Stakeholder map)&#x20;

    a. Who // What we know and what we need to know // Concerns and expectations // Desired impact // Motivation&#x20;
4. Which groups are NOT impacted by it and how might they react? (Stakeholder map)&#x20;
5. Capacity building assessment&#x20;

**Effective strategies for imparting training:**&#x20;

For many years, research and practice has recognized differences between how children and adults learn. Thus, this section highlights high-level adult learning theory along with recommendations to enhance practice for the effective implementation of GovStack's BB. &#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Rationale" %}
**Adults need to know the reason for learning something,** translating into practice, when adapting content is important that trainers clearly describe the learning objectives and provide spaces to understand participant's motivations (e.g., collecting participant's information during pre-planning stage, facilitating the "participant's expectations" at the beginning of capacity building sessions and make connections throughout the sessions). &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Experiences" %}
**Adult life experiences are a rich resource for learning (or barrier).** Over the years, adults have accumulated knowledge and experiences that can be leveraged as a resource for learning. In fact, cognitive science has shown that adults tend to refer back to past knowledge first. This experiences can be sourced through pairing exercises, group discussion, and problem solving exercises.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pertinence" %}
**As people mature there is a change in time perspective** – from future application of knowledge to immediacy. In other words, adults want to learn a skill or acquire knowledge that they can apply pragmatically to their immediate circumstances. Life or work-related situations present a more appropriate framework for adult learning than academic or theoretical approaches. &#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Learning Styles" %}
**Learning styles are influenced** by personality type, educational specialization, career choice, and current job role and task. Designing capacity building programs that engage different learning styles and adapt to different contexts are more effective.&#x20;
