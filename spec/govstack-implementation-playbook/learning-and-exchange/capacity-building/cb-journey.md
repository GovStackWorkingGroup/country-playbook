# CB Journey

### Capacity Building Journey&#x20;

Capacity-building process involves establishing and enhancing skills, instincts, abilities, processes, and resources that organizations and communities require to survive, adapt, and thrive in a rapidly changing world. Organizations share information, skills, and best practices through capacity development. GovStack's methodology is highly iterative and co-creation based [(ITU 2022).](https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/capacity-building)

The main activities within GovStack GovStack Capacity Building approach is described as follows:&#x20;

<details>

<summary>12 steps of the Capacity Framework Journey</summary>

1. Define [profiles, roles, and qualifications](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/annex/govstack-user-profiles-taxonomy) to understand the existing roles of the country. Prioritize profiles based on its criticality.&#x20;
2. Conduct capacity building needs assessment and SWOT analysis&#x20;
3. Identify gaps and try to understand what type of skills are needed, using [RFI 4 ](https://form.jotform.com/222551422978056)as a guide.   &#x20;
4. Review capacity-building inventory and identify gaps in capacity-building assets.
5. Complete curriculum map and validate with users in order to understand what type of skills are needed.&#x20;
6. Align capacity-building intervention.
7. Design learning journeys per one user persona.
8. The design team and organizational interventions.
9. Complete and cost capacity building program and MEL.
10. Consolidate capacity building activities.
11. Pilot, test, and refine training per user persona.
12. Implement, assess, and improve interventions&#x20;

The process of these activities and main tools used can be found in the Capacity Building Framework Journey below.&#x20;

Additionally, GovStack has created a supportive environment for capacity building by creating various training materials collected in [GovStack LMS](../govlearn.md). It consists of different modules which are aimed towards supporting capacity building phases during the whole [GovStack implementation Journey](https://gizonline.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ICTBuildingBlocks-CommondigitalSDGplatformwithguests/\_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5E3EDC8E-BC41-478D-9FF7-F6A701D3D8E1%7D\&file=version0.7Country%20Engagement%20Journey.pptx\&action=edit\&mobileredirect=true\&cid=83986c72-9b1b-46c0-99b3-4b4a30a6c1f7).

### Development and Customization of Capacity Building

GovStack focuses a lot on process and people within the implementation journey. Capacity building is the process in which individuals, organizations and societies, develop, strengthen and maintain the skills to implement GovStack’s Building Blocks. Capacity development is not a single intervention but an iterative process of design-application-learning-adjustment.&#x20;

#### Development and Customization Model&#x20;

The model employs design-thinking and human-centric design methodologies for learning and performance. Thus, instead of focusing on learning a topic or combination of topics, it focuses on solving problems and achieving stated organizational goals.&#x20;

It involves 3 phases as described below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Phase 1   " %}
### **Phase 1 – Pre-planning:**

1. &#x20;What is the concept you are exploring? Develop a capacity building framework that complements launching digital government services (GovStack/BB) as well helps to build digital competency/readiness among Government agencies.&#x20;
2. What is the challenge or opportunity this concept addresses?&#x20;
3.  Which groups need to be involved in addressing the concept? (Stakeholder map)&#x20;

    a. Who // What we know and what we need to know // Concerns and expectations // Desired impact // Motivation&#x20;
4. Which groups are NOT impacted by it and how might they react? (Stakeholder map)&#x20;
5. Capacity building assessment&#x20;

**Effective strategies for imparting training:**&#x20;

For many years, research and practice has recognized differences between how children and adults learn. Thus, this section highlights high-level adult learning theory along with recommendations to enhance practice for the effective implementation of GovStack's BB. &#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Rationale" %}
**Adults need to know the reason for learning something**

In practical terms, it is important that instructors clearly describe the learning objectives and provide spaces to understand participant’s motivations when preparing learning materials (e.g., collecting participants’ information during the planning stage, mapping participants’ expectations at the beginning of capacity building sessions and making connections between the content presented throughout the sessions&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Experiences" %}
**Adult life experiences are a rich resource for learning (or barrier)...**

Over the years, adults accumulate knowledge and experiences that can be leveraged as learning resources. In fact, cognitive science has shown that adults tend to resort to past knowledge as a primary learning tool. These experiences can be harnessed through pairing exercises, groups discussions, and problem-solving exercises.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pertinence" %}
**As people mature there is a change in time perspective...**

Adults tend to prioritize acquiring knowledge that ca be applied immediately. In that sense, knowledge that can directly applied to life or work-related situations can be more attractive to adult learners than purely academic or theoretical approaches
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Learning Styles" %}
**Learning styles are influenced** by personality type, educational background, career choices, and current job role and associated tasks. Designing capacity building programs that engage different learning styles techniques and adapt to different contexts can be an effective way to ensure that learning objectives are met.
