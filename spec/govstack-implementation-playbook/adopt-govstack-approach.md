# Adopt GovStack approach

## GovStack approach in the country's digital strategy and roadmap

Over the past years, digital transformation has become a policy priority along with traditional areas such as health policy, economic policy, labor and social protection policies. National Digital Strategies or National Digital Agendas have become guiding policy documents to establish the priorities and focus areas that respond to the country´s context and needs.

In most countries with a Digital Agenda/Strategy in place, digitalization of government services at scale is a pressing issue. Many leading e-government initiatives prioritize the creation of common reusable software components like identity, payments, digital signature, and forms builders, among others, to deliver various government services digitally.

A "Whole-of-Government" approach frequently entails the development of a central digital platform where government agencies across different sectors can build new e-government services without the need to redesign, test, and operate the underlying systems and infrastructure themselves from scratch.&#x20;

{% tab title="Activities / Resources " %}
A comprehensive National Digital Agenda/Strategy:

* Define activities/action lines, objectives, and goals (KPIs) according to the country's context and needs in an open and collaborative process with all stakeholders of the digital ecosystem in the Country&#x20;
* Define the governance mechanism to coordinate implementation and responsible entities for each action line&#x20;
* Define progress reporting and monitoring of KPIs&#x20;
* Set a digitisation roadmap with time frames for the execution of each action line&#x20;
* Align the Strategy to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
* Set a public dashboard to share progress in the implementation of the Agenda and its KPIs

* Launch  the digital agenda with the highest political support - Coordinate a presidential event to launch the agenda where all stakeholders that participated in the co-design are recognized and encouraged to follow with its implementation
* Start the implementation mechanism right after the launch to keep the momentum&#x20;
* Make implementation open and collaborative&#x20;
* Promote the agenda permanently&#x20;

**Examples of Digital Strategies/Agendas:**&#x20;

* In Australia, the [Digital Agenda (Digital Transformation Agency n.d.)](https://www.dta.gov.au/digital-government-strategy) sets 2025 as the target to have all government services available digitally.&#x20;

* In Ireland, the [Ireland Digital Framework (Department of the Taoiseach 2022)](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/adf42-harnessing-digital-the-digital-ireland-framework/) sets life events as the guiding principle for their service design and delivery.&#x20;
* In Mexico, the [2013 Constitutional Reform](https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota\_detalle.php?codigo=5312420\&fecha=30/08/2013#gsc.tab=0) recognized the Internet as a Constitutional Right and made an obligation of the State to have a National Universal Digital Inclusion Policy[ ](https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota\_detalle.php?codigo=5312420\&fecha=30/08/2013#gsc.tab=0)(Please use Google translate to read in your preferred language).
