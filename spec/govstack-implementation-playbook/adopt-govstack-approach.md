# Adopt GovStack approach

## GovStack approach in the country's digital strategy and roadmap

Over the past years, digital transformation has become a policy priority along with traditional areas such as health policy, economic policy, labor and social protection policies. National Digital Strategies or National Digital Agendas have become guiding policy documents to establish the priorities and focus areas that respond to the country´s context and needs.

In most countries with a Digital Agenda/Strategy in place, digitalization of government services at scale is a pressing issue. Many leading e-government initiatives prioritize the creation of a common reusable software components like identity, payments, digital signature, forms builders, among others, to deliver various government services digitally.

A "Whole-of-Government" approach frequently entails the development of a central digital platform where government agencies across different sectors can build new e-government services without the need to redesign, test, and operate the underlying systems and infrastructure themselves from scratch.&#x20;

* In Mexico, the [2013 Constitutional Reform](https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota\_detalle.php?codigo=5312420\&fecha=30/08/2013#gsc.tab=0) recognized the Internet as a Constitutional Right and made an obligation of the State to have a National Universal Digital Inclusion Policy[ ](https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota\_detalle.php?codigo=5312420\&fecha=30/08/2013#gsc.tab=0)(Please use Google translate to read in your preferred language).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scope of work" %}
A comprehensive National Digital Agenda/Strategy:

* Defines activities, objectives, and goals according to the country's context and needs in an open and collaborative process with all stakeholders of the digital ecosystem in the Country&#x20;
* Defines the governance mechanism to coordinate implementation and responsible entities for each action line&#x20;
* Defines key performance indicators as well as progress reporting and monitoring&#x20;
* Sets a time frame for the execution of each action line&#x20;
* Aligns the Strategy to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
* Set a public online space to share progress in the implementation of the Agenda and its KPIs
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activities " %}
To incorporate the GovStack approach into a Digital Strategy/Agenda:

* Incorporate an action line establishing the digital channels - website, chatbots, mobile apps, and voice commands to access government services as a priority one&#x20;
* Define a shared service policy and governance model for the development, and maintenance of government stack like identity, payments, e-signature, and interoperability, among others
* Incorporate the 'only once' principle by law, which requires that a user is only requested once to share information not available with the government.
* Define a digital service standard to unify the digital experience of the user across all digital government services&#x20;
* Establish a governance mechanism to integrate and maintain up-to-date government services catalog&#x20;
* Define a digitalization road map indicating timeframes for services releases and responsible entities&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Responsibilities" %}
Who does what:

* Head of the Digital Authority – Leads the Digital Agenda Co-Design process, coordinates the implementation and reporting mechanisms, and enables delivery of the action lines
