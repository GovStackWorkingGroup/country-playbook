# Building block approach

Version for TAC Review October 2022There is an existing logical approach practiced by leading e-gov to create a common shared platform to deliver various government services digitally.

A holistic (Whole-of-Government) digital platform that can be used by any government agency across sectors to build new e-government services without the need to redesign, test and operate the underlying systems and infrastructure themselves every time.

Instead of creating unique and disparate solutions, use a common reusable stack of Building Blocks to form the core platform engine and contextualize various e-government services on top.
